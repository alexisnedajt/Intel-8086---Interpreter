<B>Command:</B>   <B>kermit</B> <B>-</B> <B>transfer</B> <B>a</B> <B>file</B> <B>using</B> <B>the</B> <B>kermit</B> <B>protocol</B>
<B>Syntax:</B>    <B>kermit</B>
<B>Flags:</B>     (many)
<B>Example:</B>   kermit                   # Start kermit

     This is a slightly  lobotomized  <I>kermit</I>.   The  help  command,  the
script facility, and the automatic dial support have been removed. The ?
and ESC commands still work, so there is still reasonable built-in help.
The  only  V7  <I>kermit</I>  feature  that does not work is the ability to see
whether there are input characters waiting.  This means  that  you  will
not be able to ask for status during a file transfer (though this is not
critical, because <I>kermit</I> prints a dot every so often and  other  special
characters whenever there is an error or timeout).

     Start <I>kermit</I>, and then type the  following  to  open  a  2400  baud
session, for example:

        <B>set</B> <B>line</B> <B>/dev/tty1</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>speed</B> <B>2400</B>
        <B>connect</B>

(It is more convenient if you put these commands in .<I>kermrc</I> in your home
directory, so that they get done automatically whenever you run <I>kermit</I>.)
This will connect you to the modem or whatever on the serial port.   Now
log into the other system.

     When you want to transfer files, run <I>kermit</I> on  the  other  system.
To it, type

        <B>server</B>

This puts its <I>kermit</I> into a  sort  of  'slave  mode'  where  it  expects
commands from the <I>kermit</I> running on your MINIX system.  Now come back to
the command level on  MINIX  <I>kermit</I>,  by  typing  the  escape  character
followed  by <I>c</I>.  (<I>Kermit</I> will tell you the current escape character when
you do the connect command.)   At  this  point  you  can  issue  various
commands.  Your  <I>kermit</I>  will coordinate things with <I>kermit</I> on the other
machine so that you only have to  type  commands  at  one  end.   Common
commands are

        <B>get</B> <I>filename</I>
        <B>put</B> <I>filename</I>
        <B>remote</B> <I>dir</I>

Filenames can include wildcards.  By default, <I>kermit</I> works in a  system-
independent,  text  mode.  (In effect it assumes that the whole world is
MS-DOS and converts end of line and file names  accordingly.)   To  send
binary files, you will want to type

        <B>set</B> <B>file</B> <B>type</B> <B>bin</B>

on both ends before starting any transfers.   This  disables  CR  LF  to
newline  conversion.   If  both of your systems are some flavor of UNIX,
you might as well put this in .<I>kermrc</I> on both ends  and  run  in  binary
mode  all  the  time.   Also, if both systems are UNIX it is recommended
that you use

        <B>set</B> <B>file</B> <B>name</B> <B>lit</B>

on both ends.  This causes it to keep file names unchanged, rather  than
mapping to legal MS-DOS names.

     Here is a typical .<I>kermrc</I> for use on MINIX:

        <B>set</B> <B>line</B> <B>/dev/tty1</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>speed</B> <B>1200</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>esc</B> <B>29</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>file</B> <B>type</B> <B>bin</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>file</B> <B>name</B> <B>lit</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>retry</B> <B>90</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>prompt</B> <B>MINIX</B> <B>kermit&gt;</B>
        <B>connect</B>

     On the other end of the line, for example, the host at  your  local
computer  center  to which you want to transfer files, a typical profile
might be:

        <B>set</B> <B>rec</B> <B>packet</B> <B>1000</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>fil</B> <B>name</B> <B>lit</B>
        <B>set</B> <B>fil</B> <B>type</B> <B>bin</B>
        <B>server</B>


     <I>Kermit</I> has many other options and features.   For  a  pleasant  and
highly readable description of it, see the following book:

Over 400 versions of <I>kermit</I> are available, so it is likely there is  one
for  any  computer  your  MINIX  system might want to talk to.  Columbia
University  also  publishes  a  newsletter  about  <I>kermit</I>  that  can  be

<B>NAME</B>
     boot - from power on to the login prompt

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     At power on the machine reads the first sector of the  boot  device  into
     memory  and executes it.  This bootstrap code loads <B>/boot</B>, the Minix Boot
     Monitor.  The monitor loads the  kernel  binaries  from  <B>/minix</B>,  or  the
     newest file in <B>/minix</B> if it is a directory.

     The  Minix  system  is  now  running,  the  different  tasks   initialize
     themselves and control is transferred to the last one, <B>init</B>.

     <B>Init</B> is the grandparent of all Minix processes,  it  is  responsible  for
     starting login processes on each terminal, but first it runs <B>/etc/rc</B>.

     <B>/etc/rc</B> checks the state of the system and starts daemons.  First it sets
     the  keyboard  translation  to  the  mapping  in  <B>/etc/keymap</B> if present,
     followed by a call to <B><A HREF="../man8/readclock.8.html">readclock(8)</A></B> to set Minix time  from  the  hardware
     clock.   Next the file systems are checked if necessary and the <B>/usr</B> file
     system is mounted.

     The system is now ready for multiuser startup, <B>/etc/rc</B> calls  <B>/usr/etc/rc</B>
     that cleans out /tmp, /usr/tmp, and resets or cycles log files by running
     <B>/usr/etc/daily</B>, starts the <B><A HREF="../man8/update.8.html">update(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</A></B> daemons, and initializes
     the  network services.  <B>/etc/rc</B> finally runs <B>/usr/local/etc</B> to initialize
     the system in a site or host dependent way.

     <B>Init</B> reads <B>/etc/ttytab</B> and starts a <B><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty(8)</A></B> for  each  enabled  terminal
     line to allow a user to log in.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>bootopts=-s</B>
          The value of the boot variable <B>bootopts</B> is passed to <B>/etc/rc</B>.  If it
          contains  <B>-s</B>  then  the  system  will run a single user shell before
          continuing with multiuser startup.  (Note  that  one  normally  uses
          <B>boot</B> <B>-s</B> instead of setting <B>bootopts</B>.)

     <B>bootopts=-a</B>
          This flag tells that <B>/etc/fstab</B> must be ignored.   The  system  asks
          for  a device to use as /usr instead.  This will also be done if the
          root device is not as mentioned in <B>/etc/fstab</B>.

     <B>bootopts=-f</B>
          Force a file  system  check,  even  if  the  system  was  shut  down
          properly.   (Do  this  once in a while to be sure about the state of
          the file systems.)



     <B>servers=</B><I>program</I>[,<I>program</I>...]
          Names the special servers that must be started in /usr/etc/rc.   The
          setting <B>servers=inet</B> will start the TCP/IP server.

<B>BOOT</B> <B>ENVIRONMENT</B>
     Many features of the drivers inside the kernel are controlled by settings
     in  the  boot  environmenti,  like  <B>bootopts</B> above does for <B>/etc/rc</B>.  The
     values of these variables are usually colon or  comma  separated  numbers
     configuring  the driver.  <B>DPETH0</B> <B>=</B> <B>300:10</B> tells the DP ethernet driver to
     use I/O address 0x300, interrupt  request  10,  and  the  default  memory
     address  (0xD0000,  values  may be omitted) for the first ethernet board.
     (Note that IRQ 2 is redirected to IRQ 9 on AT's and PS/2's, so use 9 if a
     device is jumpered for 2.)

     Variables that are special  to  both  the  monitor  and  the  kernel  are
     described  in <B><A HREF="../man8/monitor.8.html">monitor(8)</A></B>.  This section lists extra variables or variable
     settings:

     <B>c</B><I>n</I> = <B>at</B> | <B>bios</B> | <B>esdi</B> | <B>xt</B> | <B>aha1540</B> | <B>dosfile</B> | <B>fatfile</B>
          Choose the driver that is to be used  as  controller  <I>n</I>,  in  order:
          IBM/AT  (classic  AT  or  newer  IDE),  BIOS  (any disk), ESDI (some
          PS/2s), IBM/XT, Adaptec 154x, Minix under DOS "file  as  disk",  FAT
          file  system  "file  as  disk".   By  default  <B>at</B>  is used on AT bus
          systems, <B>bios</B> on PS/2s and XTs, and <B>dosfile</B> when running under  DOS.
          Most  drivers  are  present in the kernel as distributed, but may be
          taken   out   by   modifying    <B>/usr/include/minix/config.h</B>.     See
          <B><A HREF="../man4/controller.4.html">controller(4)</A></B>.  (An XT should always use the BIOS driver, not the XT
          driver, because BIOS calls are cheap on an XT.  The XT driver can be
          used on AT machines with an old XT controller.)

     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I> = <B>on</B> | <B>off</B>
          Turn an ethernet board on or off.   The  driver  is  by  default  in
          "sink"  mode  for  all  boards.  The sink mode allows one to use the
          driver without an ethernet board installed.  The  driver  will  play
          /dev/null  for that device, i.e. nothing comes in, and anything send
          out is dropped on the floor.  If the board is  turned  on  then  the
          driver will use it to send out packets, if it is turned off then the
          driver will fail for that board.

     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I> = <I>I</I>/<I>O</I>-<I>addr</I>:<I>irq</I>:<I>mem</I>_<I>addr</I>:<I>mem</I>_<I>size</I>  (WD80x3)
     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I> = <I>I</I>/<I>O</I>-<I>addr</I>:<I>irq</I>:<B>0</B>                  (NE2000)
     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I> = <I>I</I>/<I>O</I>-<I>addr</I>:<I>irq</I>:<I>flags</I>              (3c503)
          Set the I/O address (hex),  IRQ  (decimal),  memory  address  (hex),
          memory  size  (hex),  or  flags (hex) of the <I>n</I>-th ethernet board and
          turn it on.  By default  they  are  configured  as  280:3:D0000  and
          300:5:C8000  with  the  memory  size  set  to  2000,  4000,  or 8000
          depending on the type of board found.  For the Western Digital cards
          the  IRQ  must  be what the board expects, but the memory address is
          programmed into the board by the driver.  The SMC EtherEZ  board,  a
          WD8013  successor, has only 8K memory.  This confuses the driver, so
          you need to explicitly specify the board size as  being  2000.   The
          memory  address  and  size  have  no meaning for the Novell ethernet
          boards, but the address may be explicitly set to  zero  to  indicate
          that  the  board <B>is</B> a Novell ethernet board.  For the 3Com 3c503 the
          third parameter are flags, with the low bit indicates that  the  on-
          board  tranceiver  must  be  used  if  0 (thin ethernet), or that an
          external tranceiver is used on the AUI port if set to 1.  The IRQ is
          software  settable,  and  must be specified as 2 (XT), 3, 4, 5, or 9
          (AT).  The memory address is set  on  the  board  by  jumpers.   The
          driver  does  not  support I/O mode for the 3c503.  (Note the little
          differences  between   board   types.    For   the   8003/8013   and
          NE1000/NE2000  the IRQ is fixed and the memory address variable, for
          the 3c503 the IRQ is variable and the memory address is  fixed,  but
          need not be specified.  Messy.)

     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I><B>_EA</B> = <I>e0</I>:<I>e1</I>:<I>e2</I>:<I>e3</I>:<I>e4</I>:<I>e5</I>
          Set the ethernet address of the <I>n</I>-th ethernet board.  The address is
          normally  obtained  from  the ethernet board, so only in exceptional
          circumstances is this setting ever needed.  (Use the address of  the
          main server if you want a career change.)

     <B>AHA0</B> = <I>I</I>/<I>O</I>-<I>addr</I>:<I>bus</I>-<I>on</I>:<I>bus</I>-<I>off</I>:<I>tr</I>-<I>speed</I>
          Configure the Adaptec 154xA SCSI host adapter to use the  given  I/O
          address  (hex),  Bus-on  time  (decimal), Bus-off time (decimal) and
          transfer speed (hex).  The  default  is  330:15:1:00.   The  default
          transfer  speed  is  always  5.0  Mb/s (code 00) ignoring the jumper
          settings.

     <B>aha1540</B>-<B>d</B><I>n</I> = <I>sleep</I>-<I>time</I>:<I>target</I>,<I>lun</I>
          Program SCSI disk <I>n</I> to  have  the  given  target  and  logical  unit
          number.   The  target  and lun of a tape or other SCSI device may be
          changed by setting the <B>aha1540</B>-<B>d</B><I>n</I> variable that would be used had it
          been a disk.  So tape device c0t7 can be set to target 4, lun 1 with
          aha1540-d7=:4,1.  (The <I>sleep</I>-<I>time</I> parameter is present  but  ignored
          to be compatible with Minix-vmd.)

     <B>dosfile</B>-<B>d</B><I>n</I> = <I>file</I>
          Tells the DOS virtual disk driver for disk <I>n</I> to use a given file  as
          a  disk.   The file is a DOS file name that the boot monitor must be
          able to open.

     <B>fatfile</B>-<B>d</B><I>n</I> = <I>driver</I>:<I>minor</I>:<I>file</I>
          Tells the FAT virtual disk driver for disk <I>n</I> to use a given file  as
          a disk.  The <I>driver</I> parameter is the name of driver that handles the
          disk, and <I>minor</I> is the device number of the partition where the file
          is  found.   See  <B><A HREF="../man4/controller.4.html">controller(4)</A></B>  for  names  and  numbers.  The <I>file</I>
          argument is the path to the file from the root directory down.   The
          driver  named  must also be tied to a controller with a <B>c</B><I>n</I> variable,
          so that the FAT file driver can find it.  A handy way  to  find  the
          proper  minor number is to run <B>ls -l</B> on the device where the file is
          found.  As a example, we assume the most common situation of a  disk
          file  on  the  first  partition  of  the first drive on an ATA (IDE)
          controller:

               <B>c0</B> <B>=</B> <B>fatfile</B>
               <B>c1</B> <B>=</B> <B>at</B>
               <B>fatfile</B>-<B>d0</B> <B>=</B> <B>at:1:/minix/minix.mnx</B>

     <B>TZ</B> = <B>GMT0</B>
          This sets the time zone the hardware clock is running in.  <B>Readclock</B>
          uses  this  to correctly obtain the time of the clock.  The timezone
          of the system  is  set  in  <B>/etc/profile</B>.   This  boot  variable  is
          normally not set, only a few UNIX die-hards who don't care about the
          time Windows sees and don't want to change the clock  twice  a  year
          for daylight savings use this option.  (Set Windows time to the time
          zone of Casablanca to match.)

<B>TCP/IP</B> <B>CONFIGURATION</B>
     To use TCP/IP you need to run the <B>inet</B> server, and unless you are running
     standalone  you  have to enable the ethernet driver.  See the <B>servers</B> and
     <B>DPETH</B><I>n</I> boot variables above.  The driver supports these  ethernet  cards:
     Western  Digital  8003,  Western Digital 8013, SMC Elite Ultra 16, Novell
     NE1000 and NE2000, 3Com Etherlink II (3c503).  Many newer variants of the
     WD8013,   now  under  the  SMC  brand,  may  also  work.   A  common  PCI
     reimplementation of the NE2000 using  the  Realtek  80  chipset  is  also
     supported.   Make  sure it's just a 10 mbit device and that it has a chip
     marked "RTL 8029".

     You are likely to use TCP/IP in one of three situations:

          Standalone with no connection to a network.

          In a small network with no support from a "big" host.

          Connected to a large network with address and name servers.

     In each situation you need a different set of configuration files.

  <B>Standalone</B>
     All you need is a name and an IP address.  Suppose the name is  "flotsam"
     and the IP address is 192.168.0.1 from the private IP space, then this is
     put in <B>/etc/hosts</B>:

          192.168.0.1   flotsam

     And this in <B>/etc/dhcp.conf</B>:

          host 192.168.0.0/24 {};
          interface ip0 flotsam;

  <B>Small</B> <B>Network</B>
     A network requires an  ethernet  driver.   You  need  to  enable  one  in
     &lt;minix/config.h&gt; and you need to tell <B>inet</B> that it should use that driver
     by making <B>/etc/inet.conf</B> look like this:

          eth0 DP8390 0 { default; };

     The second word (DP8390) must the name  of  the  ethernet  driver  you've
     enabled.   It  can also be seen among the drivers in the output of <B>ps</B> <B>ax</B>.
     See also <B><A HREF="../man8/inet.8.html">inet(8)</A></B>.

     In a small network there may not be a DHCP server for Minix to obtain its
     IP  address  and  name  from, so you need specify the ethernet address of
     your machine and host names  of  all  machines  in  the  hosts  and  DHCP
     configuration  files.  Suppose your machine is to be named "flotsam", and
     another machine in the network is named "jetsam", and let's  use  network
     192.168.0.0/24 again.  The file <B>/etc/hosts</B> now looks like this:

          192.168.0.1   flotsam
          192.168.0.2   jetsam

     And <B>/etc/dhcp.conf</B> like this:

          host 192.168.0.0/24 {};
          client 0:1:1b:a:68:ce flotsam;

     Use <B>hostaddr</B> <B>-e</B> to find out what the ethernet  address  of  your  network
     card is.  (The address above is an example.)

     A host needs to have all hostnames used on your  little  network  in  its
     host  file.   In the DHCP configuration you only need the client entry of
     the system itself, but it may be useful to add all client entries to make
     them all the same.

     If one of the machines is always on when any of the others is,  then  you
     can  let  it  be a DHCP server.  The other machines don't need a hosts or
     DHCP file anymore.  If flotsam is  the  server  then  its  <B>/etc/dhcp.conf</B>
     looks like this:

          host 192.168.0.0/24 {
              DNSserver flotsam;
          };
          client 0:1:1b:a:68:ce flotsam { option server; };
          client 0:0:c0:3a:12:10 jetsam;






  <B>Large</B> <B>Network</B>
     In a network with a central  network  administration  your  machine's  IP
     address  and  name  are  given  by  the  DHCP server.  You don't need any
     configuration files.  If you want your machine to do more, like  being  a
     router or something, then see <B><A HREF="../man8/inet.8.html">inet(8)</A></B> on setting up more than one network
     interface.

  <B>Simpler</B> <B>configuration</B> <B>tools</B>
     The <B>dhcpd</B> and <B>nonamed</B> daemons are complex little  programs  that  try  to
     obtain  information  about  their  surroundings automatically to tell the
     machine what its place in the network is.  It should come as no  surprise
     that  there  are  simpler  utilities to configure a machine.  On a memory
     starved machine it may even be wise to configure a machine statically  to
     get rid of the daemons.  The first daemon, <B>dhcpd</B>, can be replaced by:

          <B>ifconfig</B> <B>-h</B> <I>host</I>-<I>IP</I>-<I>address</I> <B>-n</B> <I>netmask</I>
          <B>add_route</B> <B>-g</B> <I>gateway</I>-<I>IP</I>-<I>address</I>

     to set the IP address and netmask of the machine.  Note that you can only
     do  this  if  the  machine has a static IP address, or chaos will follow.
     Remove <B>/usr/adm/dhcp.cache</B> if the DHCP daemon has run before.

     The name daemon, <B>nonamed</B>, can be replaced by an entry in <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B>
     that specifies an external name daemon:

          <B>nameserver</B> <I>nameserver</I>-<I>IP</I>-<I>address</I>

     The <B>ifconfig</B> and <B>add_route</B> calls can be placed in the  file  <B>/etc/rc.net</B>.
     Check  <B>/usr/etc/rc</B> to see how <B>/etc/rc.net</B> can be used to override running
     the normal series of network deamons.  Note that <B>/etc/rc.net</B> is  sourced,
     so  you  can  use the same variables and functions that <B>/usr/etc/rc</B> uses.
     These changes undo all the efforts to make Minix TCP/IP autoconfigurable.
     Make  very  sure  that  all the IP addresses are correct, and that the IP
     address of your machine is unique.  (Mistakenly using the  address  of  a
     main  server  will make all other machines look at your machine, and will
     make all the users of all other machines look at you.)

     Unable to obtain an IP address after 10 seconds.
          TCP/IP misconfiguration.  The DHCP daemon may  have  failed  because
          the ethernet address of the machine is not known to the DHCP server,
          the DHCP configuration is not filled in properly, or the DHCP server
          can  not  be reached.  Either talk to your Network Administrator, or
          make a dhcp.conf and a hosts file.

     1.2.3.4 login:
          If you see an IP address instead of a  host  name  then  the  system
          failed  to  translate  the  IP address.  Either talk to your Network
          Administrator to have the reverse address translation tables  fixed,
          or make a hosts file.

<B>NOTES</B>
     The 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 networks  can  be  used
     for  private networks.  (This so-called CIDR notation names an IP address
     and the number of bits in the network number.  So 172.16.0.0/12  includes
     all addresses from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.)  RFC-1597 will tell you
     why private networks are good, and RFC-1627 why they are bad.





<B>BUGS</B>
     Indefinite hangs are possible if I/O addresses or  IRQ's  are  wrong.   A
     driver  may babble about addresses and IRQ's, but that does not mean that
     what it says is true, it may just be configured that  way.   It  is  very
     difficult  to  find  peripherals on a PC automatically, and Minix doesn't
     even try.

<B>NAME</B>
     intr - run a command with interrupts enabled

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>intr</B> [<B>-d</B>] [<B>-t</B> <I>seconds</I>] <I>command</I> [arg...]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Intr</B> executes a command with keyboard interrupts  enabled,  and  standard
     input,  output  and  error redirected to the terminal or the console.  It
     may also be used for the opposite: to detach a process from the terminal.

     There are three situations where intr may be used:  From a  process  that
     has no controlling tty, like the shell running <B>/etc/rc</B> at boot time, from
     a script that runs in the background, or by the System  Administrator  to
     restart a daemon.

     In the first case <B>intr</B> will use <B>/dev/console</B> as a controlling tty and  as
     standard  input,  output  and  error.   In  the second case <B>intr</B> will use
     <B>/dev/tty</B> to connect the command to the controlling  tty.   In  the  third
     case  the  process  will be removed from the process group, and will have
     I/O redirected to <B>/dev/null</B> as input, and <B>/dev/log</B> for output.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-d</B>   Daemonize a process instead of bringing it to the foreground.  Don't
          forget  to  use  '&amp;'  to  make  the  shell not wait for the process,
          because you won't be able to kill it with the interrupt key.

     <B>-t</B> <I>seconds</I>
          Schedule an alarm to  kill  the  process  in  the  given  number  of
          seconds.   Use  it  for  a  process that may wait indefinitely for a
          service that may not be available.

<B>FILES</B>

     <B>/dev/console</B>        Main computer console.

     <B>/dev/log</B>            Message logging device.

     <B>/dev/tty</B>            Name for the controlling tty.

<B>BUGS</B>
     Maybe <B>intr</B> <B>-d</B> should fork to daemonize a process, but the author likes it
     if the process stays in the jobs list of his shell.

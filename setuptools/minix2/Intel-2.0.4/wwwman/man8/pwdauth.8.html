<B>NAME</B>
     pwdauth - password authentication program

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>/usr/lib/pwdauth</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Pwdauth</B> is a program that is used by the <B><A HREF="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt(3)</A></B> function to do the hard
     work.   It is a setuid root utility so that it is able to read the shadow
     password file.

     <B>Pwdauth</B> expects on  standard  input  two  null  terminated  strings,  the
     password  typed by the user, and the salt.  That is, the two arguments of
     the <B>crypt</B> function.  The input read in a single read call  must  be  1024
     characters or less including the nulls.  <B>Pwdauth</B> takes one of two actions
     depending on the salt.

     If the salt has the form "<B>##</B><I>user</I>" then the <I>user</I>  is  used  to  index  the
     shadow  password  file  to  obtain  the  encrypted  password.   The input
     password is encrypted with  the  one-way  encryption  function  contained
     within  <B>pwdauth</B>  and  compared  to the encrypted password from the shadow
     password file.  If equal then <B>pwdauth</B> returns the  string  "<B>##</B><I>user</I>"  with
     exit  code  0,  otherwise  exit  code  2  to  signal failure.  The string
     "<B>##</B><I>user</I>" is also returned if both  the  shadow  password  and  the  input
     password are null strings to allow a password-less login.

     If the salt is not of the form "<B>##</B><I>user</I>" then the  password  is  encrypted
     and  the  result of the encryption is returned.  If salt and password are
     null strings then a null string is returned.

     The return value is written to  standard  output  as  a  null  terminated
     string of 1024 characters or less including the null.

     The exit code is 1 on any error.

<B>NOTES</B>
     A password must be checked like in this example:

          pw_ok = (strcmp(crypt(key, pw-&gt;pw_passwd), pw-&gt;pw_passwd) == 0);

     The second argument of crypt must be the entire  encrypted  password  and
     not just the two character salt.

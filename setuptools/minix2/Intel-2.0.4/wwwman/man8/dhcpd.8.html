     dhcpd - dynamic host configuration protocol daemon

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>dhdpd</B> [<B>-qar</B>] [<B>-t</B>[<I>level</I>]] [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]] [<B>-f</B> <I>configfile</I>] [<B>-c</B>  <I>cachefile</I>]  [<B>-p</B>
           <I>poolfile</I>] [<I>host</I> ...]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Dhcpd</B> is a client  and  a  server  for  the  Dynamic  Host  Configuration
     Protocol.   As  a  client it collects DHCP data to configure the Ethernet
     networks with, and as  a  server  it  answers  DHCP  queries  from  other
     machines.

     This manual  page  describes  the  operation  of  <B>dhcpd</B>,  the  associated
     configuration  file  is described in <B><A HREF="../man5/dhcp.conf.5.html">dhcp.conf(5)</A></B>.  (The latter, together
     with <B><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></B>, is of more practical value  when  it  comes  to  getting  a
     machine's  networks  interfaces  up and running.  See the options section
     below for debugging DCHP problems.)

  <B>Initialization</B>
     On a normal startup, i.e. none of the <B>-q</B>, <B>-a</B> or  <B>-r</B>  options  are  given,
     <B>dhcpd</B>  determines  what  IP  devices  are present, and which of those are
     Ethernets.   For  each  network  it  looks   for   information   in   the
     configuration  file  as  if  it  were a server answering a query for that
     network.  If any information is found then the IP address  is  configured
     and the information stored in the cache file.

  <B>Client</B> <B>Operation</B>
     For each still unconfigured network a DHCP DISCOVER request is  broadcast
     on  that  network.  If a DHCP OFFER reply is received then a DHCP REQUEST
     is broadcast for the IP address offered, and if a DHCP  ACK  is  received
     then  the  network  is configured and the information stored in the cache
     file.

     If no reply is received then another query is sent after 4  seconds,  and
     then  again  after 8 seconds, doubling each time until 64 seconds.  Every
     64 seconds thereafter a request is broadcast until a reply is received.

     Once configured the DHCP lease, rebind and renew times are computed.   At
     the  renew  time  a DHCP REQUEST is sent to the DHCP server to extend the
     lease.  Normally we get an answer and refresh our information, but if  no
     reply  is  received  we wait for half the remaining time until the rebind
     time and keep retrying and halving the remaining time.  When  the  rebind
     time is reached the DHCP REQUEST is broadcast to try and reach some other
     DHCP server.  Halving the remaining time again and again until the  lease
     expires.   At  that  point  we go back to square one and broadcast a DHCP
     DISCOVER.



     If at any point a DHCP NAK is received we start over completely.  After a
     DHCP  OFFER an ARP request is transmitted just before the DHCP REQUEST to
     check if the address offered is already in  use.   If  an  ARP  reply  is
     received before the DHCP ACK then after the ACK we send a DHCP DECLINE to
     the server to tell that the address isn't what we want and again we start
     over.

  <B>Router</B> <B>Discovery</B>
     The gateway offered by the DHCP server is made known to the TCP/IP server
     by  sending  an  ICMP  router advertisement to the local interface with a
     short lifetime and a low priority.  Then up to three router solicitations
     are  broadcast  three  seconds  apart  to look for a router.  If a router
     answers with a router advertisement then we no longer worry about routing
     for that interface.  Otherwise the router information is refreshed before
     it expires and another solicitation is  sent  out.   This  happens  about
     twice an hour.

  <B>Server</B> <B>Operation</B>
     Once all networks so marked are configured the  daemon  starts  answering
     requests  by  other  machines or relaying requests to other DHCP servers.
     DHCP requests are answered if information for a client can  be  found  in
     the  configuration  file,  or  if a free address can be found in the pool
     file, or if a client rerequests an address it already owns.

     If the daemon is both a server and a relay for a network then it will try
     to answer a request and only relay if it has no answer.

  <B>Nothing</B> <B>more</B> <B>to</B> <B>do?</B>
     If the daemon  finds  out  that  all  networks  have  an  infinite  lease
     (configured with a fixed address), there is no router information to keep
     warm, and it isn't a server then it simply exits.

  <B>Asynchronous</B> <B>I/O?</B>
     Minix doesn't have the asynchronous I/O  that  Minix-vmd  has,  so  under
     Minix the daemon only works with one network at a time.  If it's stuck on
     the same network for 32 seconds then that network is closed  and  another
     network  is tried for 32 seconds.  This usually works ok as a client, but
     as a server it can only handle one network.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-q</B>   Read and print the  cache  and  pool  file  contents,  showing  DHCP
          information  for each network, and the IP addresses in the pool with
          lease times and current/last owners of those addresses.

     <B>-a</B>   Add the named hosts (or IP addresses) to the pool file.

     <B>-r</B>   Remove hosts from the pool file.


     [<B>-t</B>[<I>level</I>]]
          Set the test level (by default 1).  At test level 1 all networks are
          seen as unconfigured, will not be configured and no data will be put
          in the cache.  The program will just act as-if.  At test level 2 the
          interfaces  will  not be configured from the configuration file, the
          data must come from a remote server.  At level 3 the renewal, rebind
          and  lease  time  will be 60, 120 and 180 seconds.  At level 4 these
          times will be 60, 60, and 120.  At level 5 these times will  be  60,
          60,  and  60.   These test levels are meant to debug the DHCP client
          code, and are best used with a high debug level.

     [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]]
          Set the debug level (by default 1).  At debug level  1  the  program
          shows   Ethernet   and  IP  addresses  as  they  are  determined  or
          configured, DHCP messages sent and received with little detail  (one
          line  per  message),  and  memory  use.   At debug level 2 each DHCP
          packet is decoded and shown in detail.   At  debug  level  3  device
          opens  and  closes  are  shown.   The  debugging  level  may also be
          increased by 1 at runtime by sending signal <B>SIGUSR1</B>  or  turned  off
          (set to 0) with <B>SIGUSR2</B>.

     <B>-f</B> <I>configfile</I>
          Names the configuration file, by default <B>/etc/dhcp.conf</B>.

     <B>-c</B> <I>cachefile</I>
          Names the cache file, by default <B>/usr/adm/dhcp.cache</B>.

     <B>-p</B> <I>poolfile</I>
          Names the IP address pool, by default <B>/usr/adm/dhcp.pool</B>.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>

     "'/etc/dhcp.conf', line ..."
          The program exits on any configuration  file  error.   You  have  to
          correct the error and restart the program.

     "No lease set for address ..."
          There must be a lease  time  defined  for  addresses  in  the  pool.
          Correct and restart the program.

     "###### declines #.#.#.# saying '...'"
          A client with the given client identifier (usually  01  followed  by
          the  client's  Ethernet  address)  declines an IP address, hopefully
          with a message telling why.  This usually means that the IP  address
          is  already  in  use  by  another  host.   This program, acting as a
          client, will tell what other host in its message, but Windows has no
          additional info alas.

     "Got a NAK from #.#.#.# [through #.#.#.#] saying '...'"
          The server with the given IP address doesn't want us to have or keep
          the IP address we were offered or are rerequesting.  This could mean
          that the server has forgotten about us and has given our address  to
          another  machine.   This  is  bad  if  our lease hasn't yet expired.
          There may be a relay involved, and there may even be a text  message
          with precise information.

     "#.#.#.# offered by #.#.#.# is already in use by #:#:#:#:#:#"
          We got an ARP reply for an offered address.  We won't accept it, and
          send out a DECLINE when we get an ACK.

     "DHCP packet too big, ..."
          You've got way to much information in the configuration  file,  more
          than  fits in a minimum size DHCP packet.  (Notify the author if you
          really need to send more information.  He doesn't think anyone needs
          to.)

     "Pool table is corrupt"
          You will have to remove and refill the pool file.  Chaos  may  ensue
          if  there  are  active clients and they don't use ARP to detect each
          other.  (Most do.)

<B>BUGS</B>
     There is no randomization of timers.  Modern systems  don't  blink  under
     the load of several clients broadcasting a few packets in sync.

     There is no extra time spent waiting for an ARP  reply.   It  is  assumed
     that any IP stack will immediately respond, so that the DHCP server can't
     possibly beat it at sending out an ACK.  (The DHCP server has  to  commit
     the lease to stable storage first anyway.)

     Way more nonsense can be sent in  a  DHCP  packet  that  Minix  could  do
     something with, but nobody does so we don't bother.

     DHCP was invented by a rabid gerbil on speed.

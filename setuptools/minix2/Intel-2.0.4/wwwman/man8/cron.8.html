<B>NAME</B>
     cron - clock daemon

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>cron</B> [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>cron</B> daemon executes tasks that must be repeated every now  and  then
     (cron  jobs),  and  tasks  that  must  be run just once (at jobs).  It is
     normally used to run daily or weekly system maintenance scripts.  What it
     needs  to  run  and  when  is  specified in a number of "cron tables", or
     crontab files for short.  These tables are:

          <B>/usr/lib/crontab</B>
          <B>/usr/local/lib/crontab</B>
          <B>/var/lib/crontab</B>
          <B>/var/opt/</B><I>name</I><B>/lib/crontab  </B>(Minix-vmd only)
          <B>/usr/spool/crontabs/</B><I>user</I>

     These files follow the usual pattern:  One for the standard  things,  one
     for  local  tasks  per  organization,  one  for tasks per system, and one
     crontab per installed package.  (Cron  reads  <B>/usr/lib/packages</B>  to  find
     names   of  installed  packages,  it  doesn't  just  grab  everything  in
     <B>/var/opt</B>.)  The last set of files fall outside the normal  pattern,  they
     are  per  user  crontabs that one can create with the <B><A HREF="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</A></B> command.
     The file names in  <B>/usr/spool/crontabs/</B>  are  login  names  of  the  file
     owners.

     The format of a crontab file is described in <B><A HREF="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</A></B>.

  <B>AT</B> <B>jobs</B>
     <B>Cron</B> also takes care of the execution of jobs issued by  <B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at(1)</A></B>  that  are
     found in <B>/usr/spool/at/</B>.  Cron simply runs the AT job as if there were an
     "sh at-job" as a cron job at the appropriate time under  the  user-id  of
     the  owner  of the script.  The script takes care of the rest.  See <B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at(1)</A></B>
     for the details.

  <B>Job</B> <B>I/O</B>
     Standard input, output and error are the same as cron's  if  the  job  is
     started by the system crontabs or from package crontabs.  This means that
     output from system jobs usually ends up on the console  and  in  the  log
     file.   Output from personal cron jobs or at jobs are mailed to the owner
     of the job.  No mail is sent if the job is silent.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]]
          Set the debug level, by default 1.  Makes <B>cron</B> print info on what it
          happens  to be doing.  Level 1 just tells about sleep times and what
          job is executed, level 2 also shows the internal crontab data  on  a
          table load.  (With time fields translated to match those  of  <B>struct</B>
          <B>tm</B>, see <B><A HREF="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime(3)</A></B>.)

  <B>SIGNALS</B>
     <B>Cron</B> takes the following actions when sent one of the following signals:

     <B>SIGHUP</B>      Reload the crontab tables if they changed since the last time
                 they  were  loaded,  and reexamine the AT job spool.  Used by
                 <B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</A></B>.

     <B>SIGUSR1</B>     Increase the debug level by 1.

     <B>SIGUSR2</B>     Turn debugging off.

<B>ENVIRONMENT</B>
     <B>Cron</B> sets the environment variables <B>USER</B>, <B>LOGNAME</B>, <B>HOME</B>, and <B>SHELL</B> to the
     user's  login  name  (2x), home directory, and shell if a job is executed
     for a given user.  The working  directory  is  set  to  the  user's  home
     directory.   Everything  else is inherited from <B>cron</B>, exactly as <B>cron</B> got
     it when it started.  Note that commands are always passed to <B>/bin/sh</B>, not
     to the user's shell.

     System cron jobs are in principle executed with <B>cron</B>'s  environment,  use
     <B>-u</B>  <B>root</B> or the crontab file <B>/usr/spool/crontabs/root</B> if you want to give
     root the same treatment as ordinary users.

<B>FILES</B>

     <B>/usr/lib/crontab</B>         Main Minix crontab file.

     <B>/usr/local/lib/crontab</B>   Local jobs for all systems in an organization.

     <B>/var/lib/crontab</B>         System specific jobs.

     <B>/var/opt/</B><I>name</I><B>/lib/crontab</B>
                              Per package jobs for Minix-vmd.

     <B>/usr/lib/packages</B>        List of installed packages.

     <B>/usr/spool/crontabs/</B><I>user</I> Per user jobs.

     <B>/usr/spool/at/*</B>          Jobs issued by <B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at(1)</A></B>.

     <B>/usr/run/cron.pid</B>        Process id of cron when cron is  running.   Used
                              by  <B><A HREF="../man1/at.1.html">at(1)</A></B>  and  <B><A HREF="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</A></B> to send cron a hangup
                              signal.

<B>NOTES</B>
     A job is not reissued until a previous instance of it  has  exited.   The
     next  time  to execute is computed from the previous time it ran.  If job
     issuing lags behind on the system time then the next time to  run  it  is
     computed from the current system time.

<B>BUGS</B>
     <B>Cron</B> doesn't like it if the system time is changed.  If set forward  then
     cron  will  react  when  it  next wakes up by running all jobs within the
     skipped time once or twice before  it  catches  up.   Setting  the  clock
     backwards makes cron play dead until the system time passes the old time.
     (Changing the system time is bad idea anyway, and  not  just  because  of
     cron.)

     Jobs that fall in the missing hour in a change to  Daylight  Saving  Time
     are skipped.  Nothing is done in the extra hour on the change out of DST.

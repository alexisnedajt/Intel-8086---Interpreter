<B>NAME</B>
     rarpd - reverse address resolution protocol daemon

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>rarpd</B> [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]] <I>network</I>-<I>name</I> ...

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Rarpd</B> listens on the given networks  for  broadcast  packets  asking  for
     reverse address resolution.  These packets are sent by hosts at boot time
     to find out their IP address.  <B>Rarpd</B> looks  up  the  six  octet  ethernet
     number  in  the  <B>/etc/ethers</B>  file  finding  a  host  name.  This name is
     translated to the IP address of the host by a DNS lookup.  The IP address
     is then sent to the host.

     Under Minix the program forks as needed to  give  each  network  its  own
     server.   Under  Minix-vmd  all  networks are handled in the same program
     using async I/O.

  <B>Private</B> <B>Ethernet</B> <B>Addresses</B>
     For VU practical work, where students have to create their own  IP  stack
     starting at the bottom with RARP, this implementation recognizes Ethernet
     addresses starting with octet 0x76 as special.  The next octet is used as
     a  additional  host  number  and  the  next and last four octets as an IP
     address that this Ethernet address is additional for.  The IP address  is
     translated  back  to  a name, and the first component of that name gets a
     dash and the additional host number added to it.  That hostname  is  then
     looked up and its IP address returned in a RARP reply.  Example:

          76:3:c0:a8:e7:fa        Additional 3, IP 192.168.231.250

          flotsam.example.com     Reverse lookup on 192.168.231.250

          flotsam-3.example.com   Splicing in additional number

          192.168.231.42          Forward lookup

     In this example a RARP query for 76:3:c0:a8:e7:fa gets 192.168.231.42  as
     reply.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]
          Turns on debugging messages at the given level, by  default  1.   At
          level  1  you will be shown what answers are sent, and at level 2 or
          higher you will be told about queries from unknown hosts or host  on
          the  wrong  network.   The debug level can also be increased by 1 at
          runtime by sending signal <B>SIGUSR1</B> or turned  off  (set  to  0)  with
          <B>SIGUSR2</B>.

<B>NOTES</B>
     A "network name" is the device name of the IP device of a  network,  i.e.
     <B>ip0</B>, <B>ip1</B>, ...

     The RARP protocol has gone out of fashion in favour of DHCP.

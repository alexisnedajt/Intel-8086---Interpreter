     monitor, edparams - load and start Minix, modify boot parameters

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>/boot</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     This text describes the Boot Monitor, a  boot  time  interactive  program
     designed  not  only to load and start Minix, its most important task, but
     to also provide an  interface  to  configure  Minix  and  to  boot  other
     operating systems.

     The monitor is controlled with an environment that is modeled  after  the
     Bourne  shell.  This environment is filled at startup with default values
     that depend on the machine the monitor is running on and the  environment
     settings  saved  into  the boot parameters sector (the second sector on a
     device).  When the  environment  is  loaded,  the  monitor  executes  the
     function named <B>main</B>, which by default starts a simple menu.

     The environment can be manipulated at boot time from the monitor  prompt,
     but  may  also  be  edited  using  <B>edparams</B>  on a given device.  <B>Edparams</B>
     simulates the monitor as much  as  it  can,  echoing  commands  it  can't
     execute  between  brackets.  It can also be used in Makefiles and scripts
     by giving it commands as arguments.

     The DOS version of the monitor, usually named <B>boot.com</B> under  DOS,  boots
     Minix  from  a "DOS virtual disk".  <B>Boot.com</B> is a simple COM program that
     interprets a DOS file as a disk, loads a Minix  kernel  from  the  active
     partition  in  the same way as the BIOS based monitor, and executes it to
     start Minix.  All the monitor commands function in the same  way,  except
     for  the <B>boot</B> command, it can only load Minix.  The monitor grabs as much
     free memory as it can for Minix to work in, as the <B>memory</B> variable shows.
     Further  details  on  how  to  run  Minix  under DOS, Windows 95, or even
     Windows NT are written down in <B><A HREF="../man8/dosminix.8.html">dosminix(8)</A></B>.

<B>COMMANDS</B>
     The monitor is best described by the commands you can  type  to  the  '&gt;'
     prompt.  This is known as the "monitor mode".  You can enter this mode by
     hitting the Escape key.  These are the monitor commands:

     <I>name</I> = [<B>device</B>] <I>value</I>

          Set environment variable.
          Changes the value of <I>name</I> to <I>value</I>.  The optional word <B>device</B>  marks
          <I>name</I>  as  being  subject to device translation.  (See the section on
          devices.)  These (name, value) pairs are passed to  the  kernel  who
          uses  them  to  configure  itself.   These  variables  are passed by
          default:
          <B>rootdev</B>
               This is the device used as your root device.  It is by  default
               set   to   <B>ram,</B>  which  means  that  the  device  specified  by
               <B>ramimagedev</B> will be loaded into the RAM disk and used as  root.
               If you change this variable then a physical device will be used
               as root, and the RAM disk will be uninitialized  and  have  the
               size specified by <B>ramsize</B>.

          <B>ramimagedev</B>
               Describes the device to use  to  initialize  the  RAM  disk  if
               <B>rootdev</B>  is  set  to  <B>ram</B>.   It's  by default set to <B>bootdev</B>, a
               special name for the device the monitor booted from.

          <B>ramsize</B>
               The size of the RAM disk.  If the RAM disk is used for the root
               file  system  then  the  root  file  system is stretched out to
               <B>ramsize</B> if possible.

          <B>processor</B>
               Set by default to <B>86</B>, <B>186</B>, <B>286</B>, <B>386</B>, <B>486</B>, ...  depending on the
               hardware  you  have.  You can set it to a smaller value to test
               your kernel in a more limited environment.

          <B>bus</B>
               The type of system bus, either <B>xt</B>, <B>at</B>  or  <B>mca</B>.   This  answers
               basic  questions  like: "How many interrupt controllers and how
               to initialize?"  Or: "Does the keyboard have LEDs?"

          <B>memory</B>
               List of memory free for use by Minix.  It is a comma  separated
               list  of <I>base</I>:<I>size</I> pairs denoting the byte offsets and sizes of
               free  memory  in  hexadecimal.   <B>800:925E0,100000:F00000</B>  is  a
               typical  example of about 585K starting at 2K, and 15M starting
               at 1M.  (The first 2K are BIOS parameters and the 53K under the
               640K boundary is the monitor itself.)  The very last number you
               can play with if you know what you are doing.  Either  increase
               it if the monitor has it wrong, or decrease it to test if Minix
               still runs with less memory then normal.

          <B>video</B>
               Describes capabilities of the VDU:  <B>mda</B>, <B>cga</B>, <B>ega</B> or <B>vga</B>.

          <B>chrome</B>
               Either <B>color</B> or <B>mono</B>.

          <B>c0</B>
               By default <B>at</B> (AT compatibles), <B>bios</B> (XT or PS/2),  or  <B>dosfile</B>
               (running  under  DOS).   The  <B>c0</B> variable binds a driver to the
               first controller, i.e. the <B>/dev/c0*</B> devices.  The monitor  sets
               <B>c0</B>  to a suitable default, so that most machines can find their
               disk.

          <B>console</B>
               If set to a hexadecimal value it makes the monitor set the BIOS
               video  mode  to  this value when Minix is started.  This allows
               the use of video modes  with  more  rows  or  colums  than  the
               standard  80x25  mode.   You can use any text mode in the 00-FF
               range, and VESA extended modes in the 100-FFF range.  Most text
               modes  use a 9x16 font with 400 scanlines on screen, so you see
               400/16 = 25 lines.  The text mode can  be  modified  by  adding
               special  flags  to  the console setting.  Add 2000 to switch to
               480 scan lines, adding 20% more lines to the screen.  Add  4000
               to  select  a 9x14 font, so 28 or 34 lines are shown.  Add 8000
               instead to select an 8x8 font showing 50  or  60  lines.   Each
               setting  has  drawbacks.   Using  480 scanlines implies a 60 Hz
               refresh, so  the  screen  may  flicker.   The  8x8  font  looks
               squashed.  More letters on screen require more memory, so there
               is less for virtual consoles.  Interesting  modes  to  try  are
               4003  (80x28),  2003  (80x30), 6003 (80x34), 8003 (80x50), A003
               (80x60),  109  (132x25),  10A  (132x43),  10B   (132x50),   10C
               (132x60).   The  109  VESA  mode is often available, and can be
               modified like mode 3.  Use mode 7 instead of 3 for  monochrome.
               Which modes and flags work can only be found out by experiment.
               More parameters may follow the mode number that are of interest
               to the console driver, see <B><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></B>.

          <B>dosfile</B>-<B>d0</B>
               Set by the DOS version of  the  monitor  to  the  name  of  the
               virtual  disk,  i.e.  the <I>virdisk</I> argument as shown above.  The
               "dosfile" driver will use this as the name of the file  to  use
               as a disk.

          Two variables are only used by the monitor,  even  though  they  are
          passed to the kernel too:

          <B>image</B>
               The name of the file containing the kernel  image,  by  default
               <B>minix</B>.   If  it  refers  to a directory however then the newest
               file inside the directory is chosen to  be  the  kernel  image.
               The  names inside <B>/minix/</B> are best set to the Minix version you
               are using, which looks good when the monitor prints  its  name.
               Rules for pretty printing image names:

                    A '/' or '_' is changed to a space.

                    The first letter is changed from lowercase to uppercase.

                    An 'r' if followed by a digit changes to " revision ".

          <B>label</B>
               If set then only processes marked with this label or without  a
               label are loaded from the image.

          <B>Installboot</B> <B>-boot</B> will create functions to select images and labels.
          These functions will set <B>label</B> and <B>image</B> and echo what you selected.
          The two numbers separated by a colon used as an image name tell  the
          starting sector and sector count of the image on disk.

     <I>name</I>() <I>command</I>
          Define function.
          Functions may be used to bundle a set of commands, so that  you  can
          easily  boot  Minix  with a different set of parameters then normal.
          E.g.

               ram() { rootdev=ram; boot }

          will allow you to run Minix with  the  root  device  on  RAM  for  a
          change,  if you normally use a real device as root.  There are three
          predefined functions, <B>leader</B>, with default  value  an  <B>echo</B>  command
          that  shows  the  monitor's startup banner, <B>main</B>, with default value
          <B>menu</B>, and <B>trailer</B>, with default value  a  command  that  clears  the
          screen.   The  monitor  executes  <B>leader;main</B> at startup to show the
          banner message and a menu.  The <B>trailer</B> function  is  executed  just
          before  Minix is started.  These three functions can be redefined as
          you please.

     <I>name</I>(<I>key</I>) <I>command</I>
          Define kernel selecting function.
          The menu command uses functions like these to add  menu  entries  to
          select  a  different  kernel  from  a  boot disk.  <B>Installboot</B> <B>-boot</B>
          produces these functions when the images are labeled.  The label  <B>AT</B>
          would give:

               AT(a) {label=AT;image=42:626;echo AT kernel selected;menu}

          With the menu option:

               a       Select AT kernel

          Typing <B>a</B> will then execute the <B>AT</B> function above.

     <I>name</I>(<I>key</I>,<I>text</I>) <I>command</I>
          User defined menu option.
          This variant may be used to make any menu entry you like:

               dos(d,Boot MS-DOS) boot d0p0

          <I>Text</I> may be anything, even parentheses if they match.

     <I>name</I>
          Call function.
          If <I>name</I> is a user defined function then its value  is  expanded  and
          executed  in  place  of  <I>name</I>.   Try  a  recursive  one  like 'rec()
          {rec;xx}' one day.  You can see the monitor run out  of  space  with
          nice messages about using <B><A HREF="../man1/chmem.1.html">chmem(1)</A></B> to increase it's heap.

     <B>boot</B> [<B>-</B><I>opts</I>]
     <B>boot</B> <I>device</I>
          Boot Minix or another O.S.
          Without an argument, <B>boot</B> will load  and  execute  the  Minix  image
          named  by the <B>image</B> variable.  With options the variable <B>bootopts</B> is
          first set to <B>-</B><I>opts</I> before Minix is started,  and  unset  when  Minix
          returns.   With  a  <I>device</I>  argument,  <B>boot</B> loads the boot sector of
          <I>device</I> into memory and  jumps  to  it,  starting  another  operating
          system.   You  would  normally use partitions on the first hard disk
          for this command (d0p[0-3]), using d0 will also work  (choosing  the
          active  partition).   One  can  also boot devices on the second hard
          disk (d1, d1p[0-3]) if the bootstrap writer  did  not  hardwire  the
          disk number to disk 0.
          Some Operating Systems can only be booted from the active partition,
          if  you  use a '*', e.g.  <B>boot</B> <B>*d0p2</B>, then partition 2 is first made
          active.  You'll then need to use

               <B>installboot</B> <B>-m</B> <B>/dev/c0d0</B> <B>/usr/mdec/jumpboot</B> <I>keys</I>

          with  <I>keys</I>  chosen  so  that  Minix  is  booted  at  startup.   (See
          <B><A HREF="../man8/installboot.8.html">installboot(8)</A></B>.)

     <B>ctty</B> <I>n</I>
          Copies output to and takes input from serial line <I>n</I>  (0-3)  at  9600
          baud,  8 bits, no parity.  This allows you to control a Minix system
          remotely through an RS-232 connection.

     <B>delay</B> [<I>msec</I>]
          Delay (500 msec default).
          Fast booting speed was one of the objectives when this  program  was
          created,  so  a  hard  disk  boot usually takes only a fraction of a
          second.  If you need some time (to  hit  Escape,  or  stare  at  the
          numbers) you can use <B>delay</B> to make the monitor pause for a specified
          number of milliseconds.

     <B>echo</B> <I>word</I> ...
          Print these words.
          Used to display messages, like the startup  banner.   Echo  normally
          prints  the  words  with spaces in between and a newline at the end.
          Echo understands special '\' escape sequences as follows:

               \       (At the end) Don't print a newline.
               \n      Print a newline.
               \v      Print the monitor's version numbers.
               \c      Clear the screen.
               \w      Wait until a RETURN is typed
               \\      Print a backslash.

     <B>ls</B> [<I>directory</I>]
          List contents of a directory.
          Useful when looking for kernel images.

     <B>menu</B>
          Menu driven startup.
          This command allows you to execute functions defined with a <I>key</I>.  If
          no  menu  functions  have  been  defined then <B>menu</B> will use this one
          hidden built-in function:

               *(=,Start Minix) boot

          Kernel selecting functions only add new options to this set, but  if
          you define a two argument function yourself then the above one is no
          longer shown, allowing you to customize the menu  completely.   Your
          first function definition should therefore be one that starts Minix.

          Menu entries are shown in the same order as <B>set</B> shows them.  If  you
          don't like the order then you have to unset the functions and retype
          them in the proper order.

          If you  type  a  key  then  a  scheduled  trap  is  killed  and  the
          appropriate  menu  function  is  executed.  If you need more time to
          choose then hit the spacebar.  A key not on the menu  also  kills  a
          trap, but does nothing more.

     <B>save</B>
          Save environment.
          This will save all the  environment  variables  and  functions  with
          nondefault  values to the parameter sector (the second sector on the
          boot device), so they are automatically set the next time  you  boot
          the monitor.

     <B>set</B>
          Show environment.
          Show the current values of the environment variables and  functions.
          Default  values  are  shown  between parentheses to distinguish them
          from values that were explicitly set.

     <B>trap</B> <I>msec</I> <I>function</I>
          Schedule function.
          Schedules a function to be executed after <I>msec</I>  milliseconds.   Only
          the  monitor  mode cannot be interrupted, a scheduled trap is killed
          when the prompt is printed.  Example:

               main() {trap 10000 boot; menu}

          This gives you 10 seconds to choose a menu option  before  Minix  is
          booted.

     <B>unset</B> <I>name</I> ...
          Unset environment variables.
          Removes the named variables and functions from the environment,  and
          sets  special  variables back to their default values.  This is also
          the only way to remove the "device name translation" property from a
          variable.

     <B>exit</B>
          Exit the monitor.
          Reboot the machine, exit to Minix or exit to DOS as appropriate.

     <B>off</B>
          Turn the PC off.
          If the PC supports power management  then  turn  it  off,  otherwise
          print some error messages and do nothing.

     <B>{</B> <I>command</I>; ... <B>}</B>
          Bundle commands.
          Treat a number of commands as a single command.  Used  for  function
          definitions when a function body must contain more than one command.

<B>DEVICES</B>
     The Minix kernel can't do anything with device names, so they have to  be
     translated  to device numbers before they are passed to the kernel.  This
     number is found under the st_rdev field (see <B><A HREF="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</A></B>) of the file on  the
     boot  file  system.   The  monitor will look for the device file with the
     working directory set to '/dev'.  If it can't find the device  name  then
     it will translate names like 'ram', 'fd1', 'c0d1p0', 'c1d0p2s0', and even
     the obsolete 'hd2a' to what it itself thinks the numbers should be.

     The special name <B>bootdev</B> is translated to the name of the  device  booted
     from,  like 'fd0', or 'c0d0p1s0', and then searched for in /dev.  <B>Bootdev</B>
     can only be translated to a device for the first controller, and only  if
     the  disks  on  that controller are numbered without "gaps".  (The master
     device on the second IDE channel is always d2 on Minix.   The  BIOS  will
     call it disk 0, 1, or 2 depending on the number of disks on the first IDE
     channel.)

     Controller numbers are meaningless to the BIOS, so everything is  assumed
     to be attached to controller 0.  You can omit <B>c0</B> for device names, and it
     is best to always omit <B>c0</B> for the <B>boot</B> command, and  to  always  use  the
     full name for variables passed to Minix.





<B>EXTENSIONS</B>
     A few extensions have been made to this program for kernel hackers.  They
     may  be triggered by setting bits in the flags word in the kernel startup
     code (the mpx file.)  The flag bits are:

     0x0001    Call kernel in 386 mode.

     0x0002    Do not make space for the bss areas of processes other than the
               kernel.

     0x0004    Use the stack size set by <B><A HREF="../man1/chmem.1.html">chmem(1)</A></B>.

     0x0008    Load MM, FS, etc. into extended memory.

     0x0010    No need to patch process sizes into the kernel.

<B>BUGS</B>
     The <B>delay</B> command will hang forever on the original IBM PC (not the XT!).
     Not that it matters, as everything takes forever on that box.

     By redefining <B>leader</B> one can easily hide the identity of this program.

<B>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</B>
     Earl Chew, for the inspiration his ShoeLace package provided,  unless  he
     wants  to  file  a  "look  and  feel"  suit against me, then I will say I
     modeled it after the Sun ROM boot monitor, which is also true.

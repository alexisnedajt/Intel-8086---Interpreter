<B>NAME</B>
     init - grandparent of all processes

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The first program started by Minix is <B>init</B>.   The  actions  performed  by
     <B>init</B> can be summarized by this pseudo shell program:

          # Open 0, 1, 2.
          exec &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/log 2&gt;&amp;1

          # Run the system initialization script.
          sh /etc/rc $bootopts

          &gt;/etc/utmp
          echo reboot &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp

          while :; do
                  # Wait for a process to exit, but don't always block.
                  wait

                  # Record logout.  (Not in this dumb way, of course.)
                  if "pid is in my tables" $pid
                  then
                          echo "logout $pid" &gt;/etc/utmp
                          echo "logout $pid" &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp
                  fi

                  # Start a new session.
                  while read line type getty init
                  do
                          if idle $line
                          then
                                  $init ... &lt;$tty &gt;$tty
                                  $getty &lt;$tty &gt;$tty 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
                                  pid=$!
                                  "add pid to tables" $pid
                                  echo "login $line $pid" &gt;/etc/utmp
                                  echo "login $line $pid" &gt;&gt;/usr/adm/wtmp
                          fi
                  done &lt; /dev/ttytab
          done

     The first action of <B>init</B> is to run <B>/etc/rc</B> to initialize  the  system  as
     described  in <B><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></B>.  <B>Init</B> then enters its main loop where it waits for
     processes to exit, and starts processes on each  enabled  terminal  line.
     The  file <B>/etc/ttytab</B> contains a list of terminal devices, their terminal
     types, the program to execute on them to  allow  one  to  login  (usually
     <B><A HREF="../man8/getty.8.html">getty(8)</A></B>),  and  the  program  to  execute  first  to initialize the line
     (usually <B><A HREF="../man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</A></B>).  These fields may be left out to indicate that a  line
     is  disabled  or  that initialization is not necessary.  The commands are
     searched using the path <B>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</B>.

     <B>Init</B> accepts several signals that must be sent to process id 1.   (It  is
     the first process, so natually its process id is 1.)  The signals are:

     <B>SIGHUP</B>
          When receiving a hangup signal, <B>init</B> will forget  about  errors  and
          rescan  <B>ttytab</B>  for  processes  to  execute.   <B>Init</B> normally rescans
          <B>ttytab</B> each time it feels the need to  respawn  a  process,  so  the
          hangup  signal is only needed if a line has been shut down, or after
          a terminate signal.  Note that after turning a  line  off  you  will
          have to kill the process running on that line manually, <B>init</B> doesn't
          do that for you.

     <B>SIGTERM</B>
          Normally sent by programs that halt or reboot Minix.  Causes <B>init</B> to
          stop spawning new processes.

     <B>SIGABRT</B>
          Sent by the keyboard driver when the <B>CTRL</B>-<B>ALT</B>-<B>DEL</B> key combination is
          typed.   Causes  <B>init</B>  to  run the <B>shutdown</B> command.  A second abort
          signal makes <B>init</B> halt the system directly with a system call.   The
          keyboard  driver  halts  the system, without a sync, after the third
          CTRL-ALT-DEL.

  <B>Minix</B> <B>vs.</B> <B>Minix</B>-<B>vmd</B>
     There are a few differences between standard Minix and Minix-vmd  on  how
     <B>init</B>  is  run.   The  <B>/etc/rc</B>  file is executed under standard Minix with
     input connected to  <B>/dev/console</B>,  but  under  Minix-vmd  this  is  still
     <B>/dev/null</B>.  This means that under Minix-vmd processes must be reconnected
     to <B>/dev/console</B> with the <B><A HREF="../man8/intr.8.html">intr(8)</A></B> program if they need  user  interaction.
     Minix-vmd  passes  the  value  of  the <B>bootopts</B> boot variable to /etc/rc.
     Standard Minix does not.

<B>FILES</B>

     <B>/etc/ttytab</B>              List of terminals devices.

     <B>/etc/utmp</B>                List of currently logged in users.

     <B>/usr/adm/wtmp</B>            Login/logout history.

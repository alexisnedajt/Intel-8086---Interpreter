<B>NAME</B>
     nonamed - not a name daemon, but acts like one

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>nonamed</B> [<B>-qs</B>] [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]] [<B>-p</B> <I>port</I>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Nonamed</B> is not  a  name  daemon.   It  can  answer  simple  queries  from
     <B>/etc/hosts</B>,  but anything else is relayed to a real name daemon.  <B>Nonamed</B>
     maintaines a small cache of replies it has seen from a name  daemon,  and
     will  use  this  cache  to minimize traffic if the machine is permanently
     connected to the Internet, or to answer requests if the machine is  often
     disconnected from the Internet, i.e. a computer at home.

     On startup <B>nonamed</B> sends a simple query to each of its  name  servers  to
     see  if  one  is up.  This is repeated every five minutes in an "at home"
     situation, or when necessary if the current name daemon doesn't  respond.
     The  first  name  server  to answer is used as the current name server to
     answer queries.

     If no name servers are found in the DHCP data or <B>/etc/hosts</B> then only the
     hosts  file  is  used  to answer queries, and any query for a name not in
     that file gets a failure response.

     <B>Nonamed</B> accepts both UDP and TCP queries under Minix-vmd.  Under standard
     Minix  only  UDP  queries  are  accepted.  256 relayed UDP queries can be
     outstanding before it forgets where the first one came from.

     Using the hosts file, <B>nonamed</B> can answer simple DNS queries to  translate
     a  host  name to an IP address, or an IP address to a host name.  Suppose
     <B>/etc/hosts</B> looks like this:

          10.0.0.1       flotsam.cs.vu.nl www
          10.0.0.2       jetsam.cs.vu.nl

     Then queries for the host names  listed  can  be  answered  with  the  IP
     addresses  to  the  left of them.  An alias like "www" above is seen as a
     CNAME for the first host name on the line, in  the  same  domain  as  the
     first  host  name  if  unqualified (no dots).  A reverse lookup for an IP
     address on the left is answered by the first host name on the right.   If
     more  than  one match is possible then all matches are put in the answer,
     so all IP addresses of multihomed hosts can be listed by multiple entries
     in the hosts file.

     Requests  for  names  like  "flotsam.cs.vu.nl.cs.vu.nl"  that  are  often
     generated  on  a domain search for an already fully qualified domain name
     are recognized and made to fail.  This kludge avoids a lot of unnecessary
     requests to possibly unreachable name servers and client timeouts.


     The name "localhost" in any domain is given the IP address 127.0.0.1.

     <B>Nonamed</B> employs several timeouts for efficient operation:

     If no UDP reply is seen in four seconds then a new search is started  for
     a  name  server in the hope of finding one that does work.  A failing TCP
     connection will also invoke a search, the TCP connection is then made  to
     the  new name server.  A client using UDP will retry eventually, a client
     using TCP will notice nothing but a short delay.   If  a  TCP  connection
     fails  after  5  tries  then  an  answer is sought in the hosts file, and
     failing that the connection is closed.

     Any TCP operation is given five minutes to show  any  action  before  the
     connection is aborted.

     UDP replies from a name server are put in a cache of by default 8 (16-bit
     system) or 16 kilobytes (32-bit system).  New queries are first sought in
     the cache, and if found answered from the cache.  An entry in  the  cache
     is  expired when the resource record with the smallest TTL (time to live)
     expires, unless its expire time is artificially extended by the  "%stale"
     parameter   (see   below).   An  answer  from  the  cache  has  all  TTLs
     appropriately lowered, and the AA bit ("answer authoritive") is  cleared.
     Any  request  answered  by  stale  data  is  refreshed as soon as <B>nonamed</B>
     notices that one of the external name daemons is reachable.

     Data is only cached if it is has "no error" result code, or  a  "no  such
     domain" result code with a SOA record in the name server section, and all
     records have a nonzero TTL.  The %stale parameter has no  effect  on  the
     decision to cache a result.

     The cache is rewritten to the cache file five minutes after a  new  entry
     has  been  added.   Mere  changes to the order in the cache don't cause a
     rewrite.

  <B>Configuration</B> <B>through</B> <B>/etc/hosts</B>
     The real name servers, stale  data  extension,  and  cache  size  can  be
     configured by special entries in the hosts file.  For example:

          86400        %ttl         # Answers from this file get this TTL
          2419200      %stale       # Stale data may linger on for 4 weeks
          32768        %memory      # 32k cache size
          10.0.0.1     %nameserver  # flotsam
          172.16.24.3  %nameserver  # dns1.example.com
          172.16.24.6  %nameserver  # dns2.example.com

          10.0.0.1     flotsam.home.example.com www
          10.0.0.2     jetsam.home.example.com



     In this example we have two machines, flotsam and  jetsam,  that  are  at
     home.   Answers from the hosts file get a TTL of one day, by default this
     is one hour.  Normally there is no connection to  the  Internet,  so  any
     stale  data  in  the cache is allowed to linger on for 2419200 seconds (4
     weeks) before it is finally discarded.  The  cache  size  is  set  to  32
     kilobytes.   The first name server is the flotsam.  On the flotsam itself
     this entry is ignored, but the jetsam will now run its  requests  through
     flotsam  if  possible.   This  means that both flotsam and jetsam use the
     cache of the flotsam.  The other nameserver  entries  are  external  name
     servers of the Internet provider.

     If no nameservers are listed in the hosts file  then  they  are  obtained
     from data gathered by DHCP.  This is the preferred situation.

     If the hosts file contains a line that says:

          <B>include</B> <I>file</I>

     Then the current hosts file is closed and the file named is read next.

  <B>Automatic</B> <B>calling</B>
     If your connection to the  Internet  is  set  up  on  demand,  either  in
     software  on  the machine that has the modem, or by a special box such as
     an ISDN router, then you need to  filter  the  name  server  probes  that
     <B>nonamed</B>  sends  out  every  five  minutes to see if a real name daemon is
     reachable.  These probes need to be recognized as packets that  must  not
     trigger  a  call,  and  that  must  not keep the line up.  You can either
     filter all IP packets destined for port 53  decimal  (the  <B>domain</B>  port).
     This  may  be  a bit too much, the first packet out is often a normal DNS
     request (not a probe), so you may want to do better.  A probe by  <B>nonamed</B>
     is  a  nonrecursive request for the name servers of the root domain.  You
     can recognize them by looking at the flags, they are all off.  Here is  a
     typical  probe  in hex (twenty octets per line), followed by the names of
     interesting fields, and the octets values you should look for:

          45 00 00 2D C8 19 00 00 1D 11 53 18 AC 10 66 41 AC 10 18 03
          00 35 00 35 00 19 79 93 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 02 00 01

          ip ip ip ip ip ip ip ip ip ip ip ip si si si si di di di di
          sp sp dp dp xx xx xx xx id id fl fl qd qd an an ns ns ar ar
          dn ty ty cl cl

          45 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx 11 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
          xx xx 00 35 xx xx xx xx xx xx 00 00 xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
          xx xx xx xx xx

          (ip = IP header, si = source IP, di = dest IP, sp = source port,  dp
          =  dest  port,  id  = DNS ID, fl = DNS flags, qd = query count, an =
          answer count, ns = nameserver count, ar = additional records  count,
          dn = domain (""), ty = type (NS), cl = class (IN).)

     So if a packet has octets 45, 11, 00 35, and 00  00  at  the  appropriate
     places  then  don't  let it cause a call.  Read the documentation of your
     software/router to find out how to do this.  Hopefully it is possible  to
     view  the contents of the packet that triggered the last call.  If so you
     simply let <B>nonamed</B> bring up the line once with a probe.

  <B>Remote</B> <B>information</B>
     The program version and name servers it is working with can  be  obtained
     with:

          host -r -v -c chaos -t txt version.bind. <I>server</I>

     <I>Server</I> is the name or IP address of the host whose name server  you  want
     to  know  this  of.  (This call is really an undocumented hack to ask the
     version numbers of the BIND name daemon.  It just had to  be  implemented
     for <B>nonamed</B> as well.)

     The % variables in the hosts file can be viewed like this:

          host -r -t a %nameserver. <I>server</I>

     Don't forget the dot at the end of the name.  %ttl  and  %stale  will  be
     shown  as  a  dotted  quad,  e.g.  0.36.234.0.   The  proper value can be
     computed as 36 * 65536 + 234 * 256 + 0 = 2419200.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     The options are only useful when debugging <B>nonamed</B>, although  it  can  be
     very instructive to watch DNS queries being done.

     <B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]
          Set debugging level to <I>level</I> (by default <B>1</B>.)   Debug  mode  1  makes
          <B>nonamed</B>  decode  and  display  the  DNS  queries and replies that it
          receives, sends and relays.  In  debug  mode  2  it  prints  tracing
          information about the internal jobs it executes.  In debug mode 3 it
          core dumps when an error causes it to exit.  The debugging level may
          also  be  increased  by  1  at  runtime by sending signal <B>SIGUSR1</B> or
          turned off (set to 0) with <B>SIGUSR2</B>.

     [<B>-p</B> <I>port</I>]
          Port to listen on instead of the normal <B>domain</B> port.

     [<B>-q</B>] Read the cache file with the debug  level  set  to  2,  causing  its
          contents to be printed, then exit.

     [<B>-s</B>] Run  single:  ignore  hosts  or  cache  file,  only  use  the   DHCP
          information.   This  allows another <B>nonamed</B> to be run on a different
          interface to serve a few programs that run there.

<B>FILES</B>

     /etc/hosts     Hosts to address translation table and configuration file.

     /usr/run/nonamed.pid
                    Process ID of the currently running <B>nonamed</B>.

     /usr/adm/nonamed.cache
                    Copy of the cache.  Read when the program starts,  written
                    five  minutes  after  something  has been added to it, and
                    written when  a  SIGTERM  signal  is  received,  which  is
                    normally sent at system shutdown.

     /usr/adm/dhcp.cache
                    Data gathered by the DHCP daemon.   Among  lots  of  other
                    junk it lists name servers that we should use.

<B>NOTES</B>
     Do not use the %stale parameter for a PC that is  directly  connected  to
     the  Internet.  You run the risk of getting wrong answers, a risk that is
     only worth taking for a system  that  is  mostly  disconnected  from  the
     Internet.

     You can specify one or more remote name servers  in  <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B>  so
     that  nonamed  isn't  needed.   This  will  save  memory, but you'll lose
     <B>nonamed</B>'s cache and its "offline" tricks.  That's no problem if  you  can
     use a neighbouring name daemon on another PC at home.

     The default cache size seems to be more than enough for normal  use,  but
     if  you  do  decide  to  make it larger then don't forget to increase the
     stack size of the program under standard Minix.

     Don't let two  <B>nonamed</B>'s  forward  queries  to  each  other.   They  will
     pingpong a query over the network as fast as they can.

<B>BUGS</B>
     The idea of serving "stale DNS data"  will  probably  make  some  purists
     violently sick...

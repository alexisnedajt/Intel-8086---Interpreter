     config - configuring Minix tasks and servers

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     Minix has a number of configuration files containing parameters that  can
     be  changed to enable or disable a device driver, to change the number of
     times a resource can be used, or to tune the performance of  the  system.
     We  will  name  the  file  that  contains  the parameter, the name of the
     parameter, and the values it can be set to.  Some comments  are  prefixed
     by  "8086"  for  Minix  running  in  16-bit  real  mode, "286" for 16-bit
     protected mode, and "386" for 32-bit protected mode.  Configuration  file
     names  can be &lt;<I>file</I>.<I>h</I>&gt; for a file in <B>/usr/include/</B>, or a simple file name
     for a file in <B>/usr/src/</B>.

     There may be several definitions for a parameter with only  one  that  is
     active.    Which   one  this  is  is  easy  to  find  if  you  know  that
     <B>(CPU == INTEL)</B> is true, and <B>_WORD_SIZE</B> equals <B>2</B> in 16-bit mode, and <B>4</B>  in
     32-bit mode.

  &lt;<B>minix/config.h</B>&gt;
     This is the main configuration file for the Minix.  It contains  lots  of
     boolean variables to enable or disable drivers and a number of parameters
     that specify the sizes of system data structures:

     <B>NR_PROCS</B>
          The number of slots in the  process  table,  and  thus  the  maximum
          number  of  processes  that  can  be  run  concurrently.   Should be
          increased from the default <B>32</B> if networking is enabled  (add  <B>8</B>  for
          deamons),  and  if  more  users are using the system (add <B>4</B> for each
          active session).  There are a lot of loops in  the  kernel  scanning
          the  process  table,  so  setting <B>NR_PROCS</B> too high will slow things
          down a little bit, so don't overdo it.

     <B>NR_BUFS</B>
          The number of disk buffers in the file system server.  It is used to
          keep  frequently  used  disk  blocks  in  memory.   <B>8086</B> &amp; <B>286</B>:  The
          default is <B>40</B>, and that's about as high as it can be set.  <B>386</B>:  The
          default  is <B>80</B>, which is best increased to <B>1024</B> if you can spare the
          memory.  More will help, but the effect won't be  as  pronounced  as
          <B>1024</B>  is  more  than enough to contain the working set of one active
          user.

     <B>NR_CTRLRS</B>
          Number of tasks used for disk or tape controllers.   By  default  2,
          maximum  4.   You need a controller task for each device class to be
          handled through a <B>/dev/c</B><I>n</I><B>*</B> set of devices.

     <B>ENABLE_CACHE2</B>
          If set to 1 allows the RAM disk to be used as a  second  level  file
          system  cache.   Any  block that is evicted from the normal cache is
          both written to disk (if dirty), and  copied  to  the  second  level
          cache.   If  it  is needed again then the block is reloaded from the
          RAM disk if it is still there.  <B>8086</B>:  Forget it, you don't have any
          memory  for  it.   <B>286</B>:   Turn  it  on  and set the boot environment
          variable <B>ramsize</B> to <B>512</B> if you have the memory.   That's  enough  to
          contain  the working set of one active user, and is also the maximum
          FS can handle.  <B>386</B>:  The installation scripts sets <B>ramsize</B> to  <B>1024</B>
          if there is enough memory.  Your first point of call is to compile a
          new kernel with <B>ENABLE_CACHE2</B> off, <B>NR_BUFS</B> set to a large value, and
          <B>ramsize</B>  set  back  to zero.  A normal block cache works much better
          than a two level arrangement.

     <B>ENABLE_AT_WINI</B>
          Enables the AT or IDE disk driver.  (The IDE interface grew  out  of
          the  old  AT  disk  interface.)   Any  run of the mill PC needs this
          driver.  You need to assign a driver like this one to  a  controller
          task using one of the <B>c</B><I>n</I> boot variables.  See <B><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></B>.

     <B>ENABLE_BIOS_WINI</B>
          Enables the BIOS disk driver.  The BIOS driver uses the system  BIOS
          to  read or write disk blocks.  <B>8086</B>:  The preferred disk driver for
          XT class machines.  <B>286</B> &amp; <B>386</B>:  Use a native driver if  possible  to
          avoid switching back to real mode to make BIOS calls.  Especially on
          the 286 this is a painful affair.

     <B>ENABLE_ESDI_WINI</B>
          Enables the ESDI disk driver.  Some PS/2 models have this disk.

     <B>ENABLE_XT_WINI</B>
          Enables the XT disk driver.  Useful for early IBM/AT  machines  that
          have XT disks.  In real mode it is best to use the BIOS driver.

     <B>ENABLE_AHA1540_SCSI</B>
          Enables the Adaptec 1540 series SCSI driver.

     <B>ENABLE_DOSFILE</B>
          Enable the "DOS file as disk" driver that is used when Minix is  run
          from MS-DOS to access a large file as a disk.

     <B>ENABLE_FATFILE</B>
          Enable the "FAT file as disk" driver  that  interprets  a  FAT  file
          system  to find a large file to use as a disk.  This driver combined
          with a fast native Minix disk driver is a  better  choice  then  the
          previous  driver.   (And it works when Minix is not started from MS-
          DOS.)  This is the last driver  that  needs  to  be  assigned  to  a
          controller task.

     <B>ENABLE_SB16</B>
          Enable the Soundblaster-16 audio driver.

     <B>ENABLE_PRINTER</B>
          Enable the Printer driver.

     <B>DMA_SECTORS</B>
          The size of the DMA buffer for drivers that use DMA or other drivers
          that  can only do I/O to a single chunk of memory.  (BIOS, ESDI, XT,
          DOSFILE.)  Choose a number between <B>1</B> and <B>128</B> for the sector size  of
          this  buffer.   The  memory  cost  is  twice this amount, because of
          trouble getting it aligned in memory properly.  A value of <B>16</B> is the
          minimum to work well, choose <B>64</B> if you have enough memory.

     <B>NR_CONSOLES</B>
          Number of virtual consoles.  By default <B>2</B>, so you can have two login
          sessions  that  can  be  switched  to  by  ALT-F1,  ALT-F2  or  ALT-
          left/rightarrow.  If you have an EGA screen then you can specify  up
          to <B>4</B> virtual consoles, for VGA you can have <B>8</B>.  It is best to choose
          one less to leave some video memory to  keep  text  scrolling  fast.
          You  really  should  read <B><A HREF="../man4/console.4.html">console(4)</A></B> on this.  Note also the <B>console</B>
          boot variable, you can use it to put more characters on the  screen,
          at the cost of video memory.

     <B>ENABLE_DP8390</B>
          Master switch to enable the network drivers.  They are  required  by
          the   network   server,   <B>inet</B>.   See  <B><A HREF="../man8/boot.8.html">boot(8)</A></B>  for  information  on
          configuring network support.

     <B>ENABLE_WDETH</B>
          Enable code for the WD8003 and WD8013 cards in the network driver.

     <B>ENABLE_NE2000</B>
          Enable code for the NE1000 and NE2000 cards.

     <B>ENABLE_3C503</B>
          Enable code for the 3Com Etherlink II (3C503).

     <B>NR_PTYS</B>
          Number of pseudo terminals supported, by default <B>0</B>,  which  disables
          the  driver.   Pseudo terminals are used for incoming network logins
          by telnet or rlogin.  One pty is needed per session.

     <B>NR_RS_LINES</B>
          Number of RS-232 lines supported.  By default <B>2</B> for a normal kernel,
          but  <B>0</B>  for  a tiny kernel used for XT installation.  You can save a
          bit of memory by setting this parameter to zero if  you  don't  need
          serial lines.

  <B>fs/const.h</B>
     This file contains most of the parameters used by the file  system  code.
     Most of these cannot be changed, with the exception of these four:

     <B>NR_FILPS</B>
          Maximum number of open file descriptors for all processes  combined.
          A  "File  table overflow" error might indicate that this number must
          be increased.

     <B>NR_INODES</B>
          Maximum number of in-use files for  all  processes  combined.   Like
          above  a  "File  table  overflow"  error may also indicate that this
          number should be increased.  In cases like these one usually doubles
          both  parameters.   (If  one  table  runs  out then the other one is
          likely to run out also anyway.)

     <B>NR_SUPERS</B>
          Number of file systems that can be mounted.   Again  a  "file  table
          overflow"  error  is  given  if  this  table is full, but it will be
          produced by the <B>mount</B> command, so you  know  what's  wrong  in  this
          case.

     <B>NR_LOCKS</B>
          Number of active file locks by <B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</A></B>.  These locks are often used
          by  programs  that  update a shared file, like mail programs do with
          mail boxes.  A "no locks available" error indicates that this  table
          has run out.

  <B>kernel/bios_wini.c</B>
  <B>kernel/dosfile.c</B>
  <B>kernel/fatfile.c</B>
     The number of disks each of these drivers can handle is specified by:

     <B>MAX_DRIVES</B>
          This parameter is set to <B>4</B> for the BIOS and "DOS file" drivers,  and
          to  <B>2</B>  for the "FAT file" driver.  It can be set as high as you need
          to allow for more disks, or files as disks.  (The "FAT" driver needs
          quite some memory per disk, which is why it by default only allows 2
          disks.)  You will need to run <B><A HREF="../man8/MAKEDEV.8.html">MAKEDEV(8)</A></B> to create  the  extra  disk
          devices in <B>/dev/</B>.

  <B>inet/inet_config.h</B>
     The maximum number of TCP/IP networks is:

     <B>IP_PORT_MAX</B>
          Sets  the  maximum  number  of  networks  that  can  be  defined  in
          <B>/etc/inet.conf</B>.  <B>8086</B>, <B>286</B>:  By default 2.  <B>386</B>:  By default 4.

  <B>inet/buf.c</B>
     The number of 512 byte buffers  allocated  for  data  within  the  TCP/IP
     server is:



     <B>BUF512_NR</B>
          These buffers are a shared resource used by the server for any  data
          it  wants  to  play  with.  For incoming data this number of buffers
          determines the time packets are kept around, with  each  new  packet
          evicting an old packet.  It's no big deal if packets get lost before
          a user process reads them, packets get lost all the time.  The  only
          real  problem  is  outgoing  TCP  data.   The  default  setting  for
          <B>BUF512_NR</B> allows up to four backlogged TCP streams, i.e.  when  data
          is  output  faster then it is read.  If more buffers are needed then
          one of the TCP connections is shut down.  When this happens you will
          see  a  "not  enough  buffers  left"  error.   This could happen for
          instance if a Minix web server is assaulted by a browser that  likes
          to  open  several connections to the server simultaneously.  The fix
          is to increase <B>BUF512_NR</B> to allow more slow  outgoing  TCP  streams.
          <B>86</B>:  The default of <B>32</B> buffers can be increased up to <B>64</B>.  (The "TCP
          window size" has been limited in 16-bit mode to keep the buffer  use
          by  TCP  down.)   <B>386</B>:   The  default of <B>128</B> can be increased to any
          value you like, but <B>512</B> seems to be  more  than  enough.   Minix-vmd
          uses 512 by default, and it seems happy that way.

<B>NOTES</B>
     Associated with drivers there are device  files  to  access  the  devices
     controlled  by  the  drivers that may have to be created.  Let's simplify
     this sentence:  Type <B>ls</B> <B>/dev</B>, note  that  there  are  only  <B>c0*</B>  and  <B>c1*</B>
     devices,  and  only  for  two  disks  each.  Some devices, like the audio
     devices, are not even present.  So if you enable a  driver,  or  increase
     some limits, you also need to use <B><A HREF="../man8/MAKEDEV.8.html">MAKEDEV(8)</A></B> in <B>/dev</B> to allow programs to
     talk to the drivers.

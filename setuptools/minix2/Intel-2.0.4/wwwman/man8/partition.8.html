<B>NAME</B>
     partition - make a partition table

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>partition</B> [<B>-mfn</B>] <I>device</I> [<I>type</I>:]<I>length</I>[<B>+*</B>] ...

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Partition</B> makes a partition table on <I>device</I> using  the  types  and  sizes
     given.   It  may be used in combination with <B><A HREF="../man8/repartition.8.html">repartition(8)</A></B> for automatic
     installation of Minix.

     You  may  give  up  to  four  <I>type</I>:<I>length</I>[<B>+*</B>]  specifications   for   the
     partitions.   You  may  also specify holes before, between, and after the
     partitions.  A hole differs from a partition specification by not  having
     a type.

     The first hole is by default 1 sector  to  make  space  for  the  primary
     bootstrap and the partition table.  The other holes are 0.

     The <I>type</I> field is the type of the partitition in hexadecimal.  The <I>length</I>
     field  is  the partition's size in sectors.  The <B>+</B> or <B>*</B> may optionally be
     added to indicate that the partition must  be  expanded  to  contain  any
     leftover space on the device or to mark the partition active.

     Instead of a lenght you may use  the  word  <B>exist</B>  to  indicate  that  an
     existing  partition of the given type must be kept from the old partition
     table.

     Partitions are padded out to cylinder boundaries, except  for  the  first
     one,  it  starts  on  track  1.   Some operating systems care about this.
     Minix and MS-DOS do not.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-m</B>   Minix only, no need to pad partitions.   This  is  the  default  for
          subpartition tables.

     <B>-f</B>   Force making a partition table even if the device is too small.

     <B>-n</B>   Play-act, don't write the new table, just show what  it  would  look
          like.

<B>EXAMPLE</B>
     <B>partition</B> <B>/dev/hd0</B> <B>01:16384</B> <B>81:40000</B> <B>81:2880*</B> <B>06:20000+</B>

     Partitions disk 0 into an 8 Mb DOS partition, 20 Mb Minix /usr,  1.44  Mb
     Minix / (active), and a DOS partition of at least 10 Mb at the end of the
     disk.  (06:0+ would have been ok too, it's just a sanity check.)

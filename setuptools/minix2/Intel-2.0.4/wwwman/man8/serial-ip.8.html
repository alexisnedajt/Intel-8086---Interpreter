     serial-ip - Serial IP (SLIP or PPP) setup

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     -------
     <B>Note:</B> This text and the serial IP code is not finished.  Code needs to be
     added  to  <B>nonamed</B>  to  allow  it  to  be  used  both  with and without a
     connection to the Internet, and  by  now  there  is  a  PPP  program  for
     standard  Minix  "out  there" that will change everything that is said in
     this text.  So much to do, so little time...
     -------

     This manual page describes the Minix network setup to use serial line IP.
     The  serial IP protocol used can either be the older SLIP by means of the
     <B><A HREF="../man8/slip.8.html">slip(8)</A></B> program, or PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), the newer  and  better
     serial  IP  protocol  implemented  by  the <B><A HREF="../man8/ppp.8.html">ppp(8)</A></B> program.  Alas standard
     Minix only supports SLIP.

     In the following text all descriptions and examples will name SLIP or the
     <B>slip</B>  program, but one may just as well read PPP or <B>ppp</B>.  Where necessary
     the differences will be noted.

     A typical use of the <B>slip</B> program is like this:

          <B>slip</B> <B>/dev/psip2</B> <B>&lt;/dev/tty01</B> <B>&gt;/dev/tty01</B>

     The argument of the program, the <B>/dev/psip2</B> device, is  one  of  the  so-
     called "Pseudo IP" devices that the Minix TCP/IP driver <B><A HREF="../man8/inet.8.html">inet(8)</A></B> offers to
     implement a virtual network on.  On an ethernet IP packets  are  received
     or  transmitted  by the ethernet card, but packets on a pseudo IP network
     are channeled back to or received from a program running in  user  space,
     such  as  <B>slip</B>.   Standard  input and output are used by <B>slip</B> to exchange
     packets with another SLIP implementation.  This is  normally  through  an
     RS-232  serial line like the second serial line <B>/dev/tty01</B> as used in the
     example above.

     If we look at the flow of data over normal ethernet then this is  what  a
     TCP  connection  between  two  Minix machines, <B>telnet</B> for instance, looks
     like:

                                   [telnet]
                                      |
                                  /dev/tcp0
                                      |
                                     inet
                                      |
                                  [ethernet]
                                      |
                                     inet
                                      |

                                  /dev/tcp0
                                      |
                                 [in.telnetd]

     One-half (!) of a SLIP connection would look like this:

                                   [telnet]
                                      |
                                  /dev/tcp2
                                      |
                                     inet
                                      |
                                  /dev/psip2
                                      |
                                     slip
                                      |
                                [serial line]
                                     ...

  <B>Configuration</B> <B>for</B> <B>a</B> <B>SLIP</B> <B>network</B> <B>only</B>
     It is important to know that as far as <B>inet</B> is concerned  the  pseudo  IP
     network  is  just  another  network,  nothing  special.   So  you have to
     convince <B>inet</B> that it has to send packets out  over  that  network.   One
     does  this  by setting a default route that makes <B>inet</B> believe that there
     is a router somewhere on the pseudo-IP network.

     Assume your machine has been given the IP address  <B>192.168.0.13</B>  by  your
     service   provider.   Let's  choose  another  address  on  that  network,
     <B>192.168.0.1</B> for instance.  (You can use the address of the  SLIP  gateway
     if  you  want  to  make  it  look  pretty,  but it doesn't really matter,
     anything "out there" is ok.)  To make Minix aware of  the  situation  you
     have  to configure the pseudo IP network.  For Minix-vmd you need to look
     for the <B>if</B>-<B>then</B>-<B>else</B>-<B>fi</B> code in <B>/usr/etc/rc</B>  that  tests  if  <B>/etc/rc.net</B>
     should  be  run.   Copy  the lines in the <B>else</B> clause that starts network
     daemons to <B>/etc/rc.net</B> and add the following lines to make it  look  like
     this:

          # My SLIP interface address.
          ifconfig -h 192.168.0.13 -n 255.255.255.0

          # Standard network daemons.
          daemonize rarpd $named irdpd rip inetd

          # Default route to the outside world.
          add_route -g 192.168.0.1

     For standard Minix one has to edit <B>/etc/rc</B> instead at the  point  of  the
     XXX  comments.   The <B>ifconfig</B> goes at the first XXX, the <B>add_route</B> at the
     second XXX.  The result is conceptually the same as  the  example  above.
     The important thing is the order: Configuration, Daemons, Routes.  (First
     give addresses to the networks, let the daemons meditate over the results
     and  possibly  configure  more  networks  (rarpd), then add routes to the
     configured networks.)

     Just one thing left to do.  The system uses the  first  ethernet  network
     (<B>eth0</B>,  <B>ip0</B>,  <B>tcp0</B>,  and  <B>udp0</B>) as the default network.  With the program
     <B><A HREF="../man8/netdefault.8.html">netdefault(8)</A></B> you have  to  change  the  links  to  the  default  devices
     (<B>eth</B>/<B>psip</B>,  <B>ip</B>,  <B>tcp</B>,  and  <B>udp</B>)  to point to the first pseudo IP network
     (<B>psip2</B>, <B>ip2</B>, <B>tcp2</B>, and <B>udp2</B>):

          <B>netdefault</B> <B>psip2</B>

     In <B>/etc/hosts</B> list at least <B>localhost</B> and the name of your  machine  with
     its SLIP address.  This way your machine will boot and know its own name.
     Now you need to find a way to let your system know the addresses of other
     machines.  There are three ways:

          List the names and addresses of any other machine you wish  to  talk
          to  in <B>/etc/hosts</B>.  Drawback: This will quickly become a pretty long
          list.

          Create an <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B> that lists a nameserver at your  ISP  and
          <B>127.0.0.1</B>  (localhost).  Drawback:  With the SLIP link down it takes
          5 to 10 seconds for a name lookup to time out  on  the  remote  name
          server before the local name server is tried.

          Install the above <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B> when <B>slip</B> is started, and  remove
          it  when  <B>slip</B>  exits.   Drawback:  Long  running programs only read
          <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B> at startup, so they don't notice it changing.

          Run a real Internet name daemon from the <B>named</B>  package.   Drawback:
          Nontrivial to set up.

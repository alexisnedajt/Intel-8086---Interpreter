<B>NAME</B>
     cleantmp - clean out a tmp dir

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>cleantmp</B> [<B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]] [<B>-i</B> <I>file</I>] ...  <B>-</B><I>days</I>|<B>-f</B> [<I>directory</I> ...]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Cleantmp</B> removes all files in each of the  given  directories  and  their
     subdirectories  that  have  not  been  accessed for at least '<I>days</I>' days.
     Empty subdirectories are removed if their modified times  are  more  than
     '<I>days</I>'  days  old.   <B>Cleantmp</B>  looks at days as humans do, i.e. they last
     from midnight to midnight.  Meaning that <B>cleantmp</B>  <B>-1</B>  <B>/tmp</B>  removes  all
     files  that  were not touched after midnight last night. This may be very
     helpful, because in many cases that big  file  that  clogs  up  <B>/tmp</B>  was
     created yesterday, but less than 24 hours ago.

     The 'days' flag may be replaced by <B>-f</B>  causing  <B>cleantmp</B>  to  remove  all
     files  in the directory no matter what age.  Specifying zero days doesn't
     work, because it is assumed to be a mistake.

     <B>Cleantmp</B> knows that files and directories that have a name starting  with
     a  '.'  are special and will not delete them or files within them if they
     are not at least 14 days old.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-d</B>[<I>level</I>]]
          Set the debug level to <I>level</I> (by default 1).  Normally  only  errors
          are  reported.   Debug  level  1 lists the actions taken on standard
          error, level 2 also prints the file times used, and  level  3  makes
          <B>cleantmp</B> playact, i.e. nothing is really removed.

     <B>-i</B> <I>file</I>
          One or more <B>-i</B> options name files to  be  ignored.   Files  are  not
          removed  if  they  are  in  the  list  of  ignored files by either a
          directory entry match, or a full pathname  match.   This  option  is
          useful  to keep things like named pipes that some longlived programs
          foolishly put in temporary directories.

<B>BUGS</B>
     Don't use '<B>cleantmp</B> <B>-1</B>' shortly after midnight.

     It would be nice if one could delete files that are, say, 2 hours old.

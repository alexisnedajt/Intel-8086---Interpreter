<B>NAME</B>
     fdisk - partition a hard disk [IBM]

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>fdisk</B> [<B>-h</B><I>m</I>] [<B>-s</B><I>n</I>] [<I>file</I>]

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-h</B>   Number of disk heads is <I>m</I>

     <B>-s</B>   Number of sectors per track is <I>n</I>

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     <B>fdisk</B> <B>/dev/hd0</B>      # Examine disk partitions

     <B>fdisk</B> <B>-h9</B> <B>/dev/hd0</B>  # Examine disk with 9 heads

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     When <I>fdisk</I> starts up, it reads in the partition table  and  displays  it.
     It then presents a menu to allow the user to modify partitions, store the
     partition table on a file, or load it from a  file.   Partitions  can  be
     marked  as MINIX, DOS or other, as well as active or not.  Using <I>fdisk</I> is
     self-explanatory. However, be aware that repartitioning a disk will cause
     information  on  it  to  be  lost.  Rebooting  the  system <I>immediately</I> is
     mandatory after changing partition sizes and parameters.   MINIX,  XENIX,
     PC-IX,  and  MS-DOS all have different partition numbering schemes.  Thus
     when using multiple systems on the same disk, be careful.

     Note that MINIX, unlike MS-DOS , cannot  access  the  last  sector  in  a
     partition  with  an odd number of sectors.  The reason that odd partition
     sizes do not cause a problem with MS-DOS is that  MS-DOS  allocates  disk
     space  in units of 512-byte sectors, whereas MINIX uses 1K blocks.  <I>Fdisk</I>
     has a variety of other features that can be seen by typing <I>h</I>.

     <I>Fdisk</I> normally knows the geometry of the device  by  asking  the  driver.
     You can use the <B>-h</B> and <B>-s</B> options to override the numbers found.

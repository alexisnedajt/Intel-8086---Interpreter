<B>NAME</B>
     elvprsv - Preserve the the modified version of a file after a crash.

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>elvprsv</B> <B>["</B>-<I>why</I> <I>elvis</I> <I>died</I><B>"]</B> <B>/tmp/</B><I>filename</I><B>...</B>
     <B>elvprsv</B> <B>-R</B> <B>/tmp/</B><I>filename</I><B>...</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>elvprsv</I> preserves your edited text after <I>elvis</I> dies.   The  text  can  be
     recovered later, via the <I>elvprsv</I> program.

     For UNIX-like systems, you should never need to run this program from the
     command line.  It is run automatically when <I>elvis</I> is about to die, and it
     should be run (via /etc/rc) when the computer is booted.  THAT'S ALL!

     For non-UNIX systems such as MS-DOS, you can either use <I>elvprsv</I> the  same
     way as under UNIX systems (by running it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file), or
     you can run it separately with the "-R" flag to recover the files in  one
     step.

     If you're editing a file when <I>elvis</I> dies (due to  a  bug,  system  crash,
     power  failure, etc.)  then <I>elvprsv</I> will preserve the most recent version
     of your text.  The preserved text is stored in a  special  directory;  it
     does NOT overwrite your text file automatically.

     <I>elvprsv</I> will send mail to any user  whose  work  it  preserves,  if  your
     operating system normally supports mail.

<B>FILES</B>

     /tmp/elv*
          The temporary file that <I>elvis</I> was using when it died.

     /usr/preserve/p*
          The text that is preserved by <I>elvprsv</I>.

     /usr/preserve/Index
          A text file which lists the names of all preserved  files,  and  the
          names  of  the  /usr/preserve/p* files which contain their preserved
          text.

<B>BUGS</B>

     Due to the permissions on the /usr/preserve directory,  on  UNIX  systems
     <I>elvprsv</I>  must  be  run  as superuser.  This is accomplished by making the
     <I>elvprsv</I> executable be owned by "root" and turning on its  "set  user  id"
     bit.


     If you're editing a nameless buffer when <I>elvis</I> dies,  then  <I>elvprsv</I>  will
     pretend that the file was named "foo".

<B>NAME</B>
     lp - line printer

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>lp</B> device refers to the line printer attached to the  parallel  port.
     Any  byte  written  to this device is printed.  Only one process may have
     the device open.

     The <B>write</B> <B>(2)</B> call may return with a smaller count  then  the  number  of
     bytes  requested  to  write.   The next write call is then likely to fail
     with the error code <B>EAGAIN</B> if the printer is out of paper, or <B>EIO</B> if  the
     printer is turned off.

<B>FILES</B>

     /dev/lp   Parallel port device.

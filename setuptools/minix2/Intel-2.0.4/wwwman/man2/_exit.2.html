<B>NAME</B>
     exit, _exit - terminate a process

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>void</B> <B>_exit(int</B> <I>status</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>_exit</B> terminates a process with the following consequences:

          All of the descriptors open in the calling process are closed.  This
          may  entail  delays,  for  example,  waiting  for output to drain; a
          process in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.

          If the parent process of the calling process is executing a <B>wait</B>  or
          is interested in the SIGCHLD signal (Minix-vmd), then it is notified
          of the calling process's termination and the low-order eight bits of
          <I>status</I> are made available to it; see <B><A HREF="../man2/wait.2.html">wait(2)</A></B>.

          The parent process ID of all of the calling process's existing child
          processes  are  also  set  to 1.  This means that the initialization
          process (see <B><A HREF="../man2/intro.2.html">intro(2)</A></B>) inherits each of these processes as well.

     Most C programs call the library routine <B><A HREF="../man3/exit.3.html">exit(3)</A></B>, which performs  cleanup
     actions in the standard I/O library before calling _<I>exit</I>.

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     This call never returns.

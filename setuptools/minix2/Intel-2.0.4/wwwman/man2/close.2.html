<B>NAME</B>
     close - delete a descriptor

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>close(int</B> <I>d</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>close</B> call deletes a descriptor from the per-process object reference
     table.   If  this is the last reference to the underlying object, then it
     will be deactivated.  For example, on  the  last  close  of  a  file  the
     current  <I>seek</I> pointer associated with the file is lost; on the last close
     of a TCP/IP descriptor associated naming information and queued data  are
     discarded;  on the last close of a file holding an advisory lock the lock
     is released (see further <B><A HREF="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</A></B>).

     A close of all of a process's descriptors is automatic on <I>exit</I>, but since
     there  is  a limit on the number of active descriptors per process, <B>close</B>
     is necessary for programs that deal with many descriptors.

     When a process forks (see <B><A HREF="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</A></B>), all descriptors  for  the  new  child
     process  reference  the same objects as they did in the parent before the
     fork.  If a new process is then to be run using  <B><A HREF="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</A></B>,  the  process
     would normally inherit these descriptors.  Most of the descriptors can be
     rearranged with <B><A HREF="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2(2)</A></B> or  deleted  with  <B>close</B>  before  the  <B>execve</B>  is
     attempted,  but  if some of these descriptors will still be needed if the
     <B>execve</B> fails, it is necessary to arrange for them to  be  closed  if  the
     <B>execve</B>  succeeds.  For this reason, the call ``fcntl(d, F_SETFD, <I>flags</I>)''
     is provided, that can be used to mark a descriptor  "close  on  exec"  by
     setting the <B>FD_CLOEXEC</B> flag:

          fcntl(d, F_SETFD, fcntl(d, F_GETFD) | FD_CLOEXEC);

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of  -1  is  returned  and  the  global  integer  variable <B>errno</B> is set to
     indicate the error.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     <B>Close</B> will fail if:

     [EBADF]        <I>D</I> is not an active descriptor.

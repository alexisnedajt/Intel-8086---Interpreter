     times - get process times

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/times.h&gt;</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;time.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>times(struct</B> <B>tms</B> <B>*</B><I>buffer</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Times</B> returns time-accounting information for the current process and for
     the  terminated child processes of the current process.  All times are in
     1/CLOCKS_PER_SEC seconds.

     This is the structure returned by <B>times</B>:

          struct tms {
              clock_t   tms_utime;    /* user time for this process */
              clock_t   tms_stime;    /* system time for this process */
              clock_t   tms_cutime;   /* children's user time */
              clock_t   tms_cstime;   /* children's system time */
          };

     The user time is the number of clock ticks used by a process on  its  own
     computations.   The system time is the number of clock ticks spent inside
     the kernel on behalf of a process.  This  does  not  include  time  spent
     waiting for I/O to happen, only actual CPU instruction times.

     The children times are the sum of the children's process times and  their
     children's times.

<B>RETURN</B>
     <B>Times</B> returns 0 on success, otherwise -1 with the error code stored  into
     the global variable <B>errno</B>.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     The following error code may be set in <B>errno</B>:

     [EFAULT]       The address specified by the <I>buffer</I> parameter is not in  a
                    valid part of the process address space.

<B>NAME</B>
     chown - change owner and group of a file

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>int</B> <B>chown(const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>path</I><B>,</B> <B>int</B> <I>owner</I><B>,</B> <B>int</B> <I>group</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The file that is named by  <I>path</I>  has  its  <I>owner</I>  and  <I>group</I>  changed  as
     specified.  Only the super-user may change the owner of the file, because
     if users were able to give  files  away,  they  could  defeat  file-space
     accounting  procedures.   The owner of the file may change the group to a
     group of which he is a member.

     On some systems, <I>chown</I> clears the set-user-id and  set-group-id  bits  on
     the  file  to prevent accidental creation of set-user-id and set-group-id
     programs.

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     Zero is returned if the operation was successful; -1 is  returned  if  an
     error  occurs, with a more specific error code being placed in the global
     variable <B>errno</B>.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     <B>Chown</B> will fail and the file will be unchanged if:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EPERM]        The effective user ID is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]        The named file resides on a read-only file system.

     [EFAULT]       <I>Path</I> points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.

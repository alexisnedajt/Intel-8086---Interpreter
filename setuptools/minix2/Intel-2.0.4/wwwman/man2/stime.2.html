<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;time.h&gt;</B>

     <B>time_t</B> <B>time(time_t</B> <B>*</B><I>tp</I><B>)</B>
     <B>int</B> <B>stime(time_t</B> <B>*</B><I>tp</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The system's notion of the current Greenwich time is  obtained  with  the
     <B>time</B> call, and set with the <B>stime</B> call.  The time is expressed in seconds
     since midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970.  The time is both  returned  by
     <B>time</B>  and  stored  in the variable pointed to by <I>tp</I> unless <I>tp</I> is the null
     pointer.

     <B>Stime</B> obtains the time to set from the variable pointed to by <I>tp</I>.

     Only the super-user may set the time of day.

<B>RETURN</B>
     A 0 return value from <B>stime</B> indicates  that  the  call  succeeded.   <B>Time</B>
     returns  the  current  time  on  success.  A -1 return value indicates an
     error occurred, and in this case an error code is stored into the  global
     variable <B>errno</B>.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     The following error codes may be set in <B>errno</B>:

     [EFAULT]       The <I>tp</I> address referenced invalid memory.

     [EPERM]        A user other than the  super-user  attempted  to  set  the
                    time.

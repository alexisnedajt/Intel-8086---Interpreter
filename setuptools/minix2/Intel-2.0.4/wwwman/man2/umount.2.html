     mount, umount - mount or umount a file system

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/mount.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>mount(char</B> <B>*</B><I>special</I><B>,</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>name</I><B>,</B> <B>int</B> <I>flag</I><B>)</B>
     <B>int</B> <B>umount(char</B> <B>*</B><I>name</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Mount()</B> tells the system that the file system <I>special</I> is to be mounted on
     the file <I>name</I>, effectively overlaying <I>name</I> with the file tree on <I>special</I>.
     <I>Name</I> may of any type, except that if the root of <I>special</I> is a  directory,
     then  <I>name</I>  must  also  be  a directory.  <I>Special</I> must be a block special
     file, except for loopback mounts.  For loopback mounts a normal  file  or
     directory  is  used  for  <I>special</I>,  which  must  be seen as the root of a
     virtual device.  <I>Flag</I> is 0 for a read-write mount, 1 for read-only.

     <B>Umount()</B> removes the connection between a device and a mount point,  <I>name</I>
     may  refer  to either of them.  If more than one device is mounted on the
     same mount point then unmounting at the  mount  point  removes  the  last
     mounted  device,  unmounting a device removes precisely that device.  The
     unmount will only succeed if none of the files on the device are in use.

     Both calls may only be executed by the super-user.

     utime - set file times

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;utime.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>utime(const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>file</I><B>,</B> <B>struct</B> <B>utimbuf</B> <B>*</B><I>times</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>utime</B> call uses the "accessed" and "updated" times from  the  utimbuf
     structure pointed to by <I>times</I> to set the corresponding recorded times for
     <I>file</I>.

     Struct utimbuf is defined in &lt;utime.h&gt; as follows:

          struct utimbuf {
              time_t    actime;     /* access time */
              time_t    modtime;    /* modification time */
          };

     The caller must be the owner of the file or the super-user.  The  "inode-
     changed" time of the file is set to the current time.

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <B>errno</B> is set to indicate the error.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     <B>Utime</B> will fail if one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EINVAL]       The pathname contains a character with the high-order  bit
                    set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EPERM]        The process is not super-user and not  the  owner  of  the
                    file.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.


     [EROFS]        The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.

     [EFAULT]       <I>File</I> or  <I>times</I>  points  outside  the  process's  allocated
                    address space.

     [EIO]          An  I/O  error  occurred  while  reading  or  writing  the
                    affected inode.

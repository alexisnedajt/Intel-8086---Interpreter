<B>NAME</B>
     setuid, setgid - set user or group ID's

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>setuid(uid_t</B> <I>uid</I><B>)</B>
     <B>int</B> <B>setgid(gid_t</B> <I>gid</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Setuid</B> sets the real and effective user ID's of the  current  process  to
     <I>uid</I>.   Unprivileged users may only change both user ID's to the real user
     ID; only the super-user may make other changes.  <B>Setgid</B> does the same for
     the real and effective group ID's.

     Minix-vmd allows an unprivileged user to change ID's to the original real
     or  effective  ID  as  they  were  at  the time the process was executed.
     <B>Setgid</B> may also set the group ID's to any of the additional  group  ID's.
     If one of the remembered user ID's was 0 then any user or group ID may be
     chosen.

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <B>errno</B> is set to indicate the error.

<B>ERRORS</B>

     [EPERM]        The current process is not the  super-user  and  a  change
                    other than one of the allowed changes was attempted.

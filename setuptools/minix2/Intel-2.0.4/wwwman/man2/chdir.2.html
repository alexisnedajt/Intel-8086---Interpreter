<B>NAME</B>
     chdir - change current working directory

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</B>

     <B>int</B> <B>chdir(const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>path</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Path</I> is the pathname of a directory.   <B>Chdir</B>  causes  this  directory  to
     become  the  current working directory, the starting point for path names
     not beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a process  must
     have execute (search) access to the directory.

<B>RETURN</B> <B>VALUE</B>
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and <B>errno</B> is set to indicate the error.

<B>ERRORS</B>
     <B>Chdir</B> will fail and the current working directory will  be  unchanged  if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for any component of the  path
                    name.

     [EFAULT]       <I>Path</I> points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.

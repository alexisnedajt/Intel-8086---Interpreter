<B>NAME</B>
     serv.access - Internet service access list

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>/etc/serv.access</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>serv.access</B> file contains a list  of  rules  that  guide  the  access
     checks  made  by  the  <B><A HREF="../man3/servxcheck.3.html">servxcheck(3)</A></B>  function.   The file is a text file
     containing entries that look as follows:

          <I>service1</I> <I>service2</I> ...<B>:</B>  <I>check1</I> <I>check2</I> ...<B>;</B>

     Each of the service names is a service name from the <B>/etc/services</B>  file.
     The  same  names  are used in the <B>/etc/inetd.conf</B> configuration file that
     guides <B><A HREF="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd(8)</A></B>.

     The checks may look as follows:

     <B>+</B>
     <B>-</B>
          Allow all, or allow none.  Used to explicitly set the initial state.

     <B>+</B><I>name</I>
          Grant access to one of the services if the host name of  the  remote
          system matches <B>name</B>.

     <B>-</B><I>name</I>
          Deny access to one of the services if the host name  of  the  remote
          system matches <B>name</B>.

     <B>+</B><I>ipaddr</I>
     <B>-</B><I>ipaddr</I>
     <B>+</B><I>netaddr</I><B>/</B><I>len</I>
     <B>-</B><I>netaddr</I><B>/</B><I>len</I>
          Grants or denies access to a remote host with IP address <I>ipaddr</I>,  or
          the remote host whose IP address is within the network <I>netaddr</I>.  <I>Len</I>
          tells the number of bits used for the network address, i.e. the  top
          <I>len</I> bits of the network address must equal the host address.

     <B>log</B>
          This is not a check, but a flag that instruct  <B>servxcheck()</B>  to  log
          the  result  of  the  access  check  whether  it  succeeds or not to
          <B>/usr/adm/log</B>.  By default only failure is logged.

     The first "+" or "-" access check sets the  tone.   Read  it  as  "access
     denied  unless  +...",  or "access granted unless -...".  An access check
     will therefore almost always start with a "+" check.  To make the initial
     state  clear  you can start with a lone "+" or "-".  Checks are done from
     left to right.  A check that doesn't match does not change  the  outcome.
     A check that can't change the outcome is skipped.

     Both the service and the host names  may  contain  the  <B>*</B>  wildcard  that
     matches  any  number  of characters including none.  Letters are compared
     ignoring case.  A service name may appear in more than one  rule,  but  a
     service mentioned explicitly is not matched by wildcard patterns in later
     rules.

     A check for a hostname causes <B>servxcheck()</B> to do a reverse lookup on  the
     IP address of the remote host to find its name.  This name is then looked
     up to find the host's IP address(es).  If those  lookups  fail  then  all
     <B>-</B><I>name</I> checks cause access to be denied, and no <B>+</B><I>name</I> check grants access.
     The DNS lookup failures may be a misconfiguration, but could  indicate  a
     break-in attempt from a badly maintained host.  You can use a simple "+*"
     in an otherwise empty list to just deny misconfigured hosts.

     An IP or network address check is simply done  on  the  remote  hosts  IP
     address.   Such  a  check  has  no  overhead, but a <B>log</B> flag will cause a
     reverse lookup anyway.

     Comments start with "#" and continue until end of line.

<B>EXAMPLES</B>
     Example access file on a machine that offers most services only to  hosts
     within  the  cs.vu.nl  domain, and news (nntp) only to two machines and a
     specific network.

          # Service                 # Access list
          login shell:              +*.cs.vu.nl log;
          telnet pop smtp finger:   + log;
          nntp:                     +flotsam.cs.vu.nl +jetsam.cs.vu.nl
                                         +172.16.102.0/24 log;
          *:                        +*.cs.vu.nl;

     More paranoid example that limits all services by default, but allows ftp
     and http to the world:

          # Service                 # Access list
          ftp http:                 +;
          smtp finger:              + log;
          nntp:                     +flotsam.cs.vu.nl +jetsam.cs.vu.nl
                                         +172.16.102.0/24 log;
          *:                        +*.cs.vu.nl log;

     (Note that the last rule doesn't match  any  of  the  services  mentioned
     explicitly earlier.)

<B>NOTES</B>
     It may be wise not to put checks on telnet.   It  is  reasonably  secure,
     since  it  always requires a password, and your only way in if things are
     seriously hosed.

<B>BUGS</B>
     IP and DNS based access checks will  stop  most  crackers,  but  not  the
     really  determined ones.  Luckily Minix is sufficiently strange to thwart
     the well known cracking schemes.  But don't ever allow yourself  to  feel
     secure.

<B>NAME</B>
     configfile - generic configuration file format

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>*/etc/*.conf</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The syntax of the generic configuration file format is as follows:

          configfile:     empty
                  |       configline configfile
                  ;

          configline:     wordlist '<B>;</B>'
                  |       <B>include</B> string '<B>;</B>'
                  ;

          wordlist:       empty
                  |       word wordlist
                  |       string wordlist
                  |       '<B>{</B>' configfile '<B>}</B>' wordlist
                  ;

          empty:  ;

     A word is a sequence of letters, numbers, and  characters  from  the  set
     <B>!#$%&amp;*+</B>-<B>./&lt;=&gt;?[\]^_|~</B>.  A backslash (<B>\</B>) may be followed by a character in
     the set <B>abefnrstv</B> to form a BEL, BS, ESC, FF, NL,  CR,  SP,  TAB,  or  VT
     character.   Followed  by  up  to  three octal digits a character of that
     value is formed, and likewise for an <B>x</B> followed by up to two  hexadecimal
     digits.   Any  other  character  is  left as-is.  A backslash followed by
     whitespace  is  completely  removed  from  the  input.   (This   includes
     comments.)

     A string is started by a single or double quote, a series of  characters,
     and  ended  by  the same type of quote it started with.  Any character or
     escape with <B>\</B> may be found in a string.  Strings may not span lines.

     Tokens are separated by whitespace, being the usual whitespace characters
     and  comments.   A  comment  starts  with  the <B>#</B> character, and ends at a
     newline.

     The special word <B>include</B> tells that the file mentioned in  the  following
     string  must  be  read  and  included  at  that point.  The file is found
     relative to the directory the current configuration  file  is  found  in,
     unless  its  name  starts with a <B>/</B>.  A file that doesn't exist is seen as
     empty.



     A generic configuration file can be read with the functions described  in
     <B><A HREF="../man3/configfile.3.html">configfile(3)</A></B>.

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     Inspired by the configuration file of Paul Vixie's <B>bind</B>.

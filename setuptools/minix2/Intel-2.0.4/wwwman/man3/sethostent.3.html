<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Gethostbyname</I> and <I>gethostbyaddr</I> each return a pointer to an  object  with
     the following structure describing an internet host referenced by name or
     by  address,  respectively.   This  structure  contains  the  information
     obtained from the name server.

     struct  hostent {
             char    *h_name; /* official name of host */
             char    **h_aliases; /* alias list */
             int     h_addrtype; /* host address type */
             int     h_length; /* length of address */
             char    **h_addr_list; /* list of addresses from name server */
     };
     #define h_addr  h_addr_list[0] /* address, for backward compatibility */

     The members of this structure are:

     h_name       Official name of the host.

     h_aliases    A zero terminated array of alternate names for the host.

     h_addrtype   The  type  of  address  being  returned;  currently   always
                  AF_INET.


     h_length     The length, in bytes, of the address.

     h_addr_list  A zero terminated array of network addresses for  the  host.
                  Host addresses are returned in network byte order.

     h_addr       The first address  in  h_addr_list;  this  is  for  backward
                  compatiblity.

     When using the nameserver, <I>gethostbyname</I> will search for the  named  host
     in  the current domain and its parents unless the name ends in a dot.  If
     the  name  contains   no   dot,   and   if   the   environment   variable
     ``HOSTALAIASES''  contains the name of an alias file, the alias file will
     first be searched for an alias matching the input name.  See  <B><A HREF="../man7/hostname.7.html">hostname(7)</A></B>
     for the domain search procedure and the alias file format.

     <I>Sethostent</I> may be used to request the use of a connected TCP  socket  for
     queries.   If the <I>stayopen</I> flag is non-zero, this sets the option to send
     all queries to the name server using TCP and  to  retain  the  connection
     after  each  call  to <I>gethostbyname</I> or <I>gethostbyaddr</I>.  Otherwise, queries
     are performed using UDP datagrams.

     <I>Endhostent</I> closes the TCP connection.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>

     Error return status from <I>gethostbyname</I> and <I>gethostbyaddr</I> is indicated  by
     return  of  a  null  pointer.   The  external integer <I>h</I>_<I>errno</I> may then be
     checked to see whether this is a  temporary  failure  or  an  invalid  or
     unknown  host.   The routine <I>herror</I> can be used to print an error message
     describing the failure.  If  its  argument  <I>string</I>  is  non-NULL,  it  is
     printed,  followed  by a colon and a space.  The error message is printed
     with a trailing newline.

     <I>h</I>_<I>errno</I> can have the following values:

     HOST_NOT_FOUND  No such host is known.

     TRY_AGAIN       This is usually a temporary  error  and  means  that  the
                     local   server   did  not  receive  a  response  from  an
                     authoritative server.  A retry at  some  later  time  may
                     succeed.

     NO_RECOVERY     Some unexpected server failure was encountered.  This  is
                     a non-recoverable error.

     NO_DATA         The requested name is valid  but  does  not  have  an  IP
                     address;  this  is not a temporary error. This means that
                     the name is known to the name  server  but  there  is  no
                     address  associated  with  this  name.   Another  type of
                     request to the name server using this  domain  name  will
                     result in an answer; for example, a mail-forwarder may be
                     registered for this domain.

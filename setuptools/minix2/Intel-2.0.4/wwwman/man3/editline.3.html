     editline - command-line editing library with history

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>char</B> <B>*readline(char</B> <B>*</B><I>prompt</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Editline</I> is a library that provides an line-editing interface  with  text
     recall.   It  is  intended  to  be  compatible  with the <I>readline</I> library
     provided by the Free Software Foundation, but much smaller.  The bulk  of
     this manual page describes the user interface.

     The <I>readline</I> routine returns a line of text  with  the  trailing  newline
     removed.   The  data is returned in a buffer allocated with <B><A HREF="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</A></B>, so
     the space should be released with <B><A HREF="../man3/free.3.html">free(3)</A></B> when  the  calling  program  is
     done with it.  Before accepting input from the user, the specified <I>prompt</I>
     is displayed on the terminal.

     Each line returned is copied to the  internal  history  list,  unless  it
     happens to be equal to the previous line.

  <B>User</B> <B>Interface</B>
     A program that uses this library provides  a  simple  emacs-like  editing
     interface  to  its  users.  A line may be edited before it is sent to the
     calling program by typing either control characters or escape  sequences.
     A  control  character, shown as a caret followed by a letter, is typed by
     holding down the ``control'' key while the letter is typed.  For example,
     ``^A''  is  a  control-A.   An  escape  sequence is entered by typing the
     ``escape'' key followed by one or more characters.   The  escape  key  is
     abbreviated  as  ``ESC.''  Note that unlike control keys, case matters in
     escape sequences; ``ESC F'' is not the same as ``ESC f''.

     An editing command may be typed anywhere on the line,  not  just  at  the
     beginning.  In addition, a return may also be typed anywhere on the line,
     not just at the end.

     Most editing commands may be given a  repeat  count,  <I>n</I>,  where  <I>n</I>  is  a
     number.   To  enter  a repeat count, type the escape key, the number, and
     then the command to execute.  For  example,  ``ESC 4 ^f''  moves  forward
     four  characters.  If a command may be given a repeat count then the text
     ``[n]'' is given at the end of its description.

     The following control characters are accepted:
          ^A       Move to the beginning of the line
          ^B       Move left (backwards) [n]
          ^D       Delete character [n]
          ^E       Move to end of line
          ^F       Move right (forwards) [n]
          ^G       Ring the bell
          ^H       Delete character before cursor (backspace key) [n]
          ^I       Complete filename (tab key); see below
          ^J       Done with line (return key)
          ^K       Kill to end of line (or column [n])
          ^L       Redisplay line
          ^M       Done with line (alternate return key)
          ^N       Get next line from history [n]
          ^P       Get previous line from history [n]
          ^R       Search backward (forward if [n]) through history for text;
                   must start line if text begins with an uparrow
          ^T       Transpose characters
          ^V       Insert next character, even if it is an edit command
          ^W       Wipe to the mark
          ^X^X     Exchange current location and mark
          ^Y       Yank back last killed text
          ^[       Start an escape sequence (escape key)
          ^]c      Move forward to next character ``c''
          ^?       Delete character before cursor (delete key) [n]

     The following escape sequences are provided.
          ESC ^H   Delete previous word (backspace key) [n]
          ESC DEL  Delete previous word (delete key) [n]
          ESC SP   Set the mark (space key); see ^X^X and ^Y above
          ESC .    Get the last (or [n]'th) word from previous line
          ESC ?    Show possible completions; see below
          ESC &lt;    Move to start of history
          ESC &gt;    Move to end of history
          ESC b    Move backward a word [n]
          ESC d    Delete word under cursor [n]
          ESC f    Move forward a word [n]
          ESC l    Make word lowercase [n]
          ESC m    Toggle if 8bit chars display normally or with ``M-'' prefix
          ESC u    Make word uppercase [n]
          ESC y    Yank back last killed text
          ESC v    Show library version
          ESC w    Make area up to mark yankable
          ESC nn   Set repeat count to the number nn
          ESC C    Read from environment variable ``_C_'', where C is
                   an uppercase letter

     The <I>editline</I> library has a small macro facility.  If you type the  escape
     key  followed  by  an  uppercase  letter,  <I>C</I>,  then  the  contents of the
     environment variable _<I>C</I>_ are read in as if you  had  typed  them  at  the
     keyboard.  For example, if the variable _<I>L</I>_ contains the following:
          ^A^Kecho '^V^[[H^V^[[2J'^M
     Then typing ``ESC L'' will move to the beginning of the  line,  kill  the
     entire line, enter the echo command needed to clear the terminal (if your
     terminal is like a VT-100), and send the line back to the shell.



     The <I>editline</I> library also does filename  completion.   Suppose  the  root
     directory has the following files in it:
          bin    vmunix
          core   vmunix.old
     If you type ``rm /v'' and then the tab key.  <I>Editline</I>  will  then  finish
     off  as  much  of  the name as possible by adding ``munix''.  Because the
     name is not unique, it will then beep.  If you type the escape key and  a
     question  mark,  it  will  display  the  two choices.  If you then type a
     period and a tab, the library will finish off the filename for you:
          rm /v[TAB]<I>munix</I>.TAB<I>old</I>
     The tab key is shown by ``[TAB]'' and the automatically-entered  text  is
     shown in italics.

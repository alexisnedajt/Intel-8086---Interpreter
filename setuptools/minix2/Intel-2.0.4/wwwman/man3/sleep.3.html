<B>NAME</B>
     sleep - suspend execution for interval

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</B>

     <B>unsigned</B> <B>int</B> <B>sleep(unsigned</B> <B>int</B> <I>seconds</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The current process is suspended from execution for the number of seconds
     specified by the argument.

     The routine is implemented by setting an alarm timer and pausing until it
     occurs.   The previous state of this timer is saved and restored.  If the
     sleep time exceeds the time to the expiration of the previous timer,  the
     process  sleeps only until the signal would have occurred, and the signal
     is sent 1 second later.

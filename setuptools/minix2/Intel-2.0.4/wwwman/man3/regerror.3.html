<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     These routines implement POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions (``RE''s);  see
     <B><A HREF="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format(7)</A></B><B>.</B>   <B>Regcomp</B>  compiles  an  RE  written  as  a  string into an
     internal form, <B>regexec</B> matches that internal form against  a  string  and
     reports  results, <B>regerror</B> transforms error codes from either into human-
     readable messages, and <B>regfree</B> frees  any  dynamically-allocated  storage
     used by the internal form of an RE.

     The  header  &lt;<I>regex</I>.<I>h</I>&gt;  declares  two  structure   types,   <B>regex_t</B>   and
     <B>regmatch_t</B>,  the  former  for  compiled internal forms and the latter for
     match reporting.  It also declares the four functions, a  type  <B>regoff_t</B>,
     and a number of constants with names starting with ``REG_''.

     <B>Regcomp</B> compiles the regular expression contained in the <I>pattern</I>  string,
     subject  to  the  flags  in <I>cflags</I>, and places the results in the <B>regex_t</B>
     structure pointed to by <I>preg</I>.  <I>Cflags</I> is the bitwise OR of zero  or  more
     of the following flags:

     REG_EXTENDED  Compile modern (``extended'') REs, rather than the obsolete
                   (``basic'') REs that are the default.

     REG_BASIC     This is a synonym for  0,  provided  as  a  counterpart  to
                   REG_EXTENDED to improve readability.

     REG_NOSPEC    Compile with recognition of all special  characters  turned
                   off.   All  characters are thus considered ordinary, so the
                   ``RE''  is  a  literal  string.   This  is  an   extension,
                   compatible  with  but  not  specified  by POSIX 1003.2, and
                   should be used with caution  in  software  intended  to  be
                   portable to other systems.  REG_EXTENDED and REG_NOSPEC may
                   not be used in the same call to <I>regcomp</I>.

     REG_ICASE     Compile  for  matching  that   ignores   upper/lower   case
                   distinctions.  See <B><A HREF="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format(7)</A></B><B>.</B>


     REG_NOSUB     Compile for matching  that  need  only  report  success  or
                   failure, not what was matched.

     REG_NEWLINE   Compile  for  newline-sensitive  matching.    By   default,
                   newline  is a completely ordinary character with no special
                   meaning in either REs or strings.   With  this  flag,  `[^'
                   bracket  expressions  and  `.'  never  match newline, a `^'
                   anchor matches the null string after  any  newline  in  the
                   string  in  addition  to  its  normal function, and the `$'
                   anchor matches the null string before any  newline  in  the
                   string in addition to its normal function.

     REG_PEND      The regular expression ends, not at the first NUL, but just
                   before  the  character  pointed to by the <B>re_endp</B> member of
                   the structure pointed to by <I>preg</I>.  The <B>re_endp</B> member is of
                   type  <B>const char *</B>.  This flag permits inclusion of NULs in
                   the RE; they are considered ordinary characters.   This  is
                   an  extension,  compatible  with but not specified by POSIX
                   1003.2,  and  should  be  used  with  caution  in  software
                   intended to be portable to other systems.

     When successful, <B>regcomp</B> returns 0 and fills in the structure pointed  to
     by   <I>preg</I>.   One  member  of  that  structure  (other  than  <B>re_endp</B>)  is
     publicized:   <B>re_nsub</B>,  of  type   <B>size_t</B>,   contains   the   number   of
     parenthesized subexpressions within the RE (except that the value of this
     member is undefined if the REG_NOSUB flag was used).  If  <B>regcomp</B>  fails,
     it returns a non-zero error code; see DIAGNOSTICS.

     <B>Regexec</B> matches the compiled RE pointed to by <I>preg</I>  against  the  <I>string</I>,
     subject to the flags in <I>eflags</I>, and reports results using <I>nmatch</I>, <I>pmatch</I>,
     and the returned value.  The RE must have been  compiled  by  a  previous
     invocation of <B>regcomp</B>.  The compiled form is not altered during execution
     of <B>regexec</B>, so a  single  compiled  RE  can  be  used  simultaneously  by
     multiple threads.

     By default, the NUL-terminated string pointed to by <I>string</I> is  considered
     to  be  the  text  of an entire line, minus any terminating newline.  The
     <I>eflags</I> argument is the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:

     REG_NOTBOL    The first character of the string is not the beginning of a
                   line,  so  the `^' anchor should not match before it.  This
                   does not affect the behavior of newlines under REG_NEWLINE.

     REG_NOTEOL    The NUL terminating the string does not end a line, so  the
                   `$'  anchor  should  not  match  before  it.  This does not
                   affect the behavior of newlines under REG_NEWLINE.

     REG_STARTEND  The   string   is   considered   to   start   at   <I>string</I> +
                   <I>pmatch</I>[0].<B>rm_so</B>  and  to  have a terminating NUL located at
                   <I>string</I> + <I>pmatch</I>[0].<B>rm_eo</B> (there need not actually be a  NUL
                   at that location), regardless of the value of <I>nmatch</I>.   See
                   below  for the definition of <I>pmatch</I> and <I>nmatch</I>.  This is an
                   extension, compatible  with  but  not  specified  by  POSIX
                   1003.2,  and  should  be  used  with  caution  in  software
                   intended to be portable to other systems.  Note that a non-
                   zero  <B>rm_so</B> does not imply REG_NOTBOL; REG_STARTEND affects
                   only the location of the string, not how it is matched.

     See <B><A HREF="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format(7)</A></B> for a discussion of what is matched in situations  where
     an  RE  or  a  portion  thereof  could match any of several substrings of
     <I>string</I>.

     Normally, <B>regexec</B> returns 0 for success and the non-zero code REG_NOMATCH
     for  failure.   Other non-zero error codes may be returned in exceptional
     situations; see DIAGNOSTICS.

     If REG_NOSUB was specified in the compilation of the RE, or if <I>nmatch</I>  is
     0,  <B>regexec</B> ignores the <I>pmatch</I> argument (but see below for the case where
     REG_STARTEND is specified).  Otherwise, <I>pmatch</I>  points  to  an  array  of
     <I>nmatch</I>  structures of type <B>regmatch_t</B>.  Such a structure has at least the
     members <B>rm_so</B> and <B>rm_eo</B>, both of type <B>regoff_t</B> (a signed arithmetic  type
     at least as large as an <B>off_t</B> and a <B>ssize_t</B>), containing respectively the
     offset of the first character of a substring and the offset of the  first
     character  after the end of the substring.  Offsets are measured from the
     beginning of the <I>string</I> argument given to <B>regexec</B>.  An empty substring is
     denoted  by  equal  offsets,  both indicating the character following the
     empty substring.

     The 0th member of  the  <I>pmatch</I>  array  is  filled  in  to  indicate  what
     substring  of  <I>string</I>  was  matched  by the entire RE.  Remaining members
     report what substring was matched by parenthesized subexpressions  within
     the  RE;  member  <I>i</I>  reports subexpression <I>i</I>, with subexpressions counted
     (starting at 1) by the order of their opening parentheses in the RE, left
     to  right.   Unused  entries  in  the  array----corresponding  either  to
     subexpressions that did not participate  in  the  match  at  all,  or  to
     subexpressions that do not exist in the RE (that is, <I>i</I> &gt; <I>preg</I>-&gt;<B>re_nsub</B>)--
     --have both <B>rm_so</B> and <B>rm_eo</B> set to -1.  If a  subexpression  participated
     in  the  match  several  times, the reported substring is the last one it
     matched.  (Note, as an example in particular, that when  the  RE  `(b*)+'
     matches  `bbb', the parenthesized subexpression matches each of the three
     `b's and then an infinite number of empty strings following the last `b',
     so the reported substring is one of the empties.)

     If  REG_STARTEND  is  specified,  <I>pmatch</I>  must  point  to  at  least  one
     <B>regmatch_t</B>  (even if <I>nmatch</I> is 0 or REG_NOSUB was specified), to hold the
     input offsets  for  REG_STARTEND.   Use  for  output  is  still  entirely
     controlled  by  <I>nmatch</I>;  if  <I>nmatch</I>  is 0 or REG_NOSUB was specified, the
     value of <I>pmatch</I>[0] will not be changed by a successful <B>regexec</B>.


     <B>Regerror</B> maps a non-zero <I>errcode</I> from either  <B>regcomp</B>  or  <B>regexec</B>  to  a
     human-readable,  printable  message.  If <I>preg</I> is non-NULL, the error code
     should have arisen from use of the <B>regex_t</B> pointed to by <I>preg</I>, and if the
     error  code  came  from  <B>regcomp</B>, it should have been the result from the
     most recent <B>regcomp</B> using that <B>regex_t</B>.  (<I>Regerror</I> may be able to  supply
     a  more  detailed  message using information from the <B>regex_t</B>.)  <B>Regerror</B>
     places the NUL-terminated message into the buffer pointed to  by  <I>errbuf</I>,
     limiting the length (including the NUL) to at most <I>errbuf</I>_<I>size</I> bytes.  If
     the whole message won't fit, as  much  of  it  as  will  fit  before  the
     terminating NUL is supplied.  In any case, the returned value is the size
     of buffer needed to hold the whole message (including  terminating  NUL).
     If  <I>errbuf</I>_<I>size</I>  is  0,  <I>errbuf</I>  is ignored but the return value is still
     correct.

     If the <I>errcode</I> given  to  <B>regerror</B>  is  first  ORed  with  REG_ITOA,  the
     ``message''  that  results  is the printable name of the error code, e.g.
     ``REG_NOMATCH'', rather than  an  explanation  thereof.   If  <I>errcode</I>  is
     REG_ATOI,  then  <I>preg</I>  shall  be  non-NULL  and the <B>re_endp</B> member of the
     structure it points to must point to the printable name of an error code;
     in  this  case, the result in <I>errbuf</I> is the decimal digits of the numeric
     value of the error code (0 if the name is not recognized).  REG_ITOA  and
     REG_ATOI  are  intended  primarily  as  debugging  facilities;  they  are
     extensions, compatible with but not specified by POSIX 1003.2, and should
     be  used  with  caution  in  software  intended  to  be portable to other
     systems.  Be warned  also  that  they  are  considered  experimental  and
     changes are possible.

     <B>Regfree</B> frees  any  dynamically-allocated  storage  associated  with  the
     compiled  RE  pointed  to  by <I>preg</I>.  The remaining <B>regex_t</B> is no longer a
     valid compiled RE and the effect of supplying it to <B>regexec</B>  or  <B>regerror</B>
     is undefined.

     None of these functions references global variables except for tables  of
     constants;  all  are  safe for use from multiple threads if the arguments
     are safe.

<B>IMPLEMENTATION</B> <B>CHOICES</B>
     There are a number of decisions that 1003.2 leaves up to the implementor,
     either  by  explicitly  saying  ``undefined''  or by virtue of them being
     forbidden by the RE grammar.  This implementation treats them as follows.

     See <B><A HREF="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format(7)</A></B> for a discussion of the definition  of  case-independent
     matching.

     There is no particular limit on the length  of  REs,  except  insofar  as
     memory  is limited.  Memory usage is approximately linear in RE size, and
     largely insensitive to RE complexity,  except  for  bounded  repetitions.
     See  BUGS for one short RE using them that will run almost any system out
     of memory.

     A backslashed character other than one specifically given a magic meaning
     by 1003.2 (such magic meanings occur only in obsolete [``basic''] REs) is
     taken as an ordinary character.

     Any unmatched [ is a REG_EBRACK error.

     Equivalence classes cannot begin or end bracket-expression  ranges.   The
     endpoint of one range cannot begin another.

     RE_DUP_MAX, the limit on repetition counts  in  bounded  repetitions,  is
     255.

     A repetition  operator  (?,  *,  +,  or  bounds)  cannot  follow  another
     repetition operator.  A repetition operator cannot begin an expression or
     subexpression or follow `^' or `|'.

     `|' cannot appear first or last in a  (sub)expression  or  after  another
     `|',  i.e.  an operand of `|' cannot be an empty subexpression.  An empty
     parenthesized  subexpression,  `()',  is  legal  and  matches  an   empty
     (sub)string.  An empty string is not a legal RE.

     A `{' followed by a digit is considered the beginning  of  bounds  for  a
     bounded  repetition, which must then follow the syntax for bounds.  A `{'
     <I>not</I> followed by a digit is considered an ordinary character.

     `^' and `$' beginning and ending subexpressions in  obsolete  (``basic'')
     REs are anchors, not ordinary characters.

<B>HISTORY</B>
     Originally written by Henry Spencer.  Altered for inclusion in the 4.4BSD
     distribution.

<B>BUGS</B>
     This is an alpha release with known defects.  Please report problems.

     There  is  one  known   functionality   bug.    The   implementation   of
     internationalization  is  incomplete:  the locale is always assumed to be
     the default one of 1003.2, and only the collating elements etc.  of  that
     locale are available.

     The back-reference code is subtle and doubts linger about its correctness
     in complex cases.

     <B>Regexec</B> performance is poor.  This  will  improve  with  later  releases.
     <I>Nmatch</I> exceeding 0 is expensive; <I>nmatch</I> exceeding 1 is worse.  <B>Regexec</B> is
     largely insensitive to RE complexity  <I>except</I>  that  back  references  are
     massively  expensive.   RE  length does matter; in particular, there is a
     strong speed bonus for keeping RE length under about 30 characters,  with
     most special characters counting roughly double.

     <B>Regcomp</B> implements bounded  repetitions  by  macro  expansion,  which  is
     costly  in  time and space if counts are large or bounded repetitions are
     nested.  An RE like, say,  `((((a{1,100}){1,100}){1,100}){1,100}){1,100}'
     will (eventually) run almost any existing machine out of swap space.

     There are suspected problems with response to obscure  error  conditions.
     Notably,  certain  kinds  of  internal  overflow,  produced only by truly
     enormous REs or by multiply nested bounded repetitions, are probably  not
     handled well.

     Due to a mistake in 1003.2, things like `a)b' are legal REs  because  `)'
     is  a special character only in the presence of a previous unmatched `('.
     This can't be fixed until the spec is fixed.

     The standard's definition of back references is vague.  For example, does
     `a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d'  match  `abbbd'?   Until  the  standard  is  clarified,
     behavior in such cases should not be relied on.

     The implementation of word-boundary matching is a bit of  a  kludge,  and
     bugs may lurk in combinations of word-boundary matching and anchoring.

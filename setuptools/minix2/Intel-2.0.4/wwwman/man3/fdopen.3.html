     fopen, freopen, fdopen - open a stream

     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</B>

     <B>FILE</B> <B>*fopen(const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>filename</I><B>,</B> <B>const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>type</I><B>)</B>

     <B>FILE</B> <B>*fdopen(int</B> <I>fildes</I><B>,</B> <B>const</B> <B>char</B> <B>*</B><I>type</I><B>)</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Fopen</B> opens the file named by <I>filename</I> and associates a stream  with  it.
     <B>Fopen</B>  returns  a pointer to be used to identify the stream in subsequent
     operations.

     <I>Type</I> is a character string having one of the following values:

     "r"  open for reading

     "w"  create for writing

     "a"  append: open for writing at end of file, or create for writing

     In addition, each <I>type</I> may be followed by a "+" to have the  file  opened
     for  reading  and writing.  "r+" positions the stream at the beginning of
     the file, "w+" creates or truncates it, and "a+" positions it at the end.
     Both  reads  and  writes  may  be  used  on  read/write streams, with the
     limitation that an <B>fseek</B>, <B>rewind</B>, or reading an end-of-file must be  used
     between a read and a write or vice-versa.

     <B>Freopen</B> substitutes the named file in  place  of  the  open  <I>stream</I>.   It
     returns the original value of <I>stream</I>.  The original stream is closed.

     <B>Freopen</B> is typically used to attach the preopened constant names,  <B>stdin,</B>
     <B>stdout,</B> <B>stderr,</B> to specified files.

     <B>Fdopen</B> associates a stream with a file  descriptor  obtained  from  <B>open</B>,
     <B>dup</B>,  <B>creat</B>, or <B><A HREF="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</A></B>.  The <I>type</I> of the stream must agree with the mode
     of the open file.

<B>SEE</B> <B>ALSO</B>
     <B><A HREF="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../man3/fclose.3.html">fclose(3)</A></B>.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     <B>Fopen</B> and <B>freopen</B> return the pointer <B>NULL</B> if <I>filename</I> cannot be accessed,
     if  too  many files are already open, or if other resources needed cannot
     be allocated.



<B>BUGS</B>
     <B>Fdopen</B> is not portable to systems other than UNIX.

     The read/write <I>types</I> do not exist on all systems.  Those systems  without
     read/write  modes  will  probably  treat  the  <I>type</I> as if the "+" was not
     present.  These are unreliable in any event.

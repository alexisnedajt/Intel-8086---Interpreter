<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Malloc</B> and <B>free</B> provide  a  general-purpose  memory  allocation  package.
     <B>Malloc</B> returns a pointer to a block of at least <I>size</I> bytes beginning on a
     word boundary.

     The argument to <B>free</B> is a pointer to  a  block  previously  allocated  by
     <B>malloc</B>;  this  space  is  made  available for further allocation, but its
     contents are left undisturbed.  A call with a null <I>ptr</I> is legal and  does
     nothing.

     Needless to say, grave disorder will result  if  the  space  assigned  by
     <B>malloc</B> is overrun or if some random number is handed to <B>free</B>.

     <B>Malloc</B> maintains  multiple  lists  of  free  blocks  according  to  size,
     allocating  space  from the appropriate list.  It calls <B>sbrk</B> (see <B><A HREF="../man2/brk.2.html">brk(2)</A></B>)
     to get more memory from the  system  when  there  is  no  suitable  space
     already free.

     <B>Realloc</B> changes the size of the block pointed to by <I>ptr</I> to <I>size</I> bytes and
     returns  a  pointer  to the (possibly moved) block.  The contents will be
     unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes.  A call with a  null
     <I>ptr</I> is legal and has the same result as <B>malloc(</B><I>size</I><B>)</B>.

     <B>Calloc</B> allocates space for an array of <I>nelem</I> elements of size <I>elsize</I>. The
     space is initialized to zeros.

     <B>Alloca</B> allocates <I>size</I> bytes of space in the stack frame  of  the  caller.
     This temporary space is automatically freed on return.

     Each of the allocation routines  returns  a  pointer  to  space  suitably
     aligned  (after  possible  pointer  coercion)  for storage of any type of
     object.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     <B>Malloc</B>, <B>realloc</B> and <B>calloc</B> return a null pointer if there is no available
     memory  or  if the arena has been detectably corrupted by storing outside
     the bounds of a block.

<B>NOTES</B>
     Other implementations of <B>malloc</B>, <B>realloc</B> or  <B>calloc</B>  may  return  a  null
     pointer  if the size of the requested block is zero.  This implementation
     will always return a zero length block  at  a  unique  address,  but  you
     should  keep in mind that a null return is possible if the program is run
     to another system and that this should  not  be  mistakenly  seen  as  an
     error.

<B>BUGS</B>
     When <B>realloc</B> returns a null pointer, the block pointed to by <I>ptr</I>  may  be
     destroyed.

     <B>Alloca</B> is machine dependent; its use is discouraged.

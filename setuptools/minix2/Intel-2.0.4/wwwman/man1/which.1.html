     <B>which</B> <B>a.out</B>         # Tells which <I>a</I>.<I>out</I> will be executed

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     The $PATH shell variable controls the MINIX search rules.  If  a  command
     <I>a</I>.<I>out</I>  is  given, the shell first tries to find an executable file in the
     working directory. If that fails, it looks in various system directories,
     such  as  /<I>bin</I>  and /<I>usr</I>/<I>bin</I>. The which command makes the same search and
     gives the absolute path of the program that will be chosen,  followed  by
     other occurrences of the file name along the path.

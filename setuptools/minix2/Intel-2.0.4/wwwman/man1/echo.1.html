<B>NAME</B>
     echo - produce message in a shell script

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>echo</B> [ <B>-n</B> | <B>-e</B> ] <I>args</I>...

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Echo</I> prints its arguments on the standard output,  separated  by  spaces.
     Unless  the  <B>-n</B>  option  is  present,  a  newline is output following the
     arguments.  The <B>-e</B> option causes  <I>echo</I>  to  treat  the  escape  sequences
     specially,  as  described  in  the  following paragraph.  Only one of the
     options <B>-n</B> and <B>-e</B> may be given.

     If any of the following sequences of  characters  is  encountered  during
     output,  the  sequence  is  not output.  Instead, the specified action is
     performed:

     <B>\b</B>   A backspace character is output.

     <B>\c</B>   Subsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally used at  the  end
          of  the  last  argument  to  suppress the trailing newline that <I>echo</I>
          would otherwise output.

     <B>\f</B>   Output a form feed.

     <B>\n</B>   Output a newline character.

     <B>\r</B>   Output a carriage return.

     <B>\t</B>   Output a (horizontal) tab character.

     <B>\v</B>   Output a vertical tab.

     <B>\0</B><I>digits</I>
          Output the character whose value is given by zero to  three  digits.
          If there are zero digits, a nul character is output.

     <B>\\</B>   Output a backslash.

<B>HINTS</B>
     Remember that backslash is special to the shell and needs to be  escaped.
     To output a message to standard error, say

                 echo message &gt;&amp;2

<B>BUGS</B>
     The octal character  escape  mechanism  (\0<I>digits</I>)  differs  from  the  C
     language mechanism.

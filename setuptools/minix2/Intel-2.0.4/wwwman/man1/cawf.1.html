     cawf, nroff - C version of  the  nroff-like,  Amazingly  Workable  (text)
     Formatter

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>cawf</B> [<B>-c</B><I>config</I>] [<B>-d</B><I>device</I>] [<B>-e</B>] [<B>-f</B><I>font</I>] [<B>-h</B>] [<B>-m</B><I>acros</I>] [<I>file</I> ...]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Cawf</I> formats the text from the input <I>file</I>(s) (standard input if none)  in
     an  approximation  of <I>nroff</I>.  It comes closest to duplicating <I>nroff</I>'s <B>man</B>
     or <B>ms</B> macro package styles.  It has some limited support for  <I>nroff</I>'s  <B>me</B>
     macros.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     Options must precede file names.

     <B>-c</B><I>config</I>
          defines  an  alternate  path  to  the  device  configuration   file.
          Normally  the device configuration file is found in <I>device</I>.<I>cf</I> in the
          <I>cawf</I> library (see the <B>FILES</B> section).

          The device configuration file contains device character strings  for
          selecting  fonts and the bold or italic type faces.  See the <B>DEVICES</B>
          section for more information.

     <B>-d</B><I>device</I>
          specifies the name of the output device.  There are  three  built-in
          devices  -  ANSI, NONE and NORMAL - and other devices may be defined
          in the device configuration file.  See the <B>DEVICES</B> section for  more
          information.

          The NORMAL device is the default.

     <B>-e</B>   directs <I>cawf</I> to issue an eject (FF or ^L) after the last page.

     <B>-f</B><I>font</I>
          specifies the one font for the device, declared  with  the  <B>-d</B><I>device</I>
          option, that is to be used for the entire document.  <I>Font</I> must match
          a  font  associated  with  the  device's  stanza   in   the   device
          configuration file.  See the <B>DEVICES</B> section for more information.

          No <I>font</I> may be specified for the  built-in  devices  ANSI,  NONE  or
          NORMAL.

     <B>-h</B>   requests a help display.

     <B>-m</B><I>acro</I>
          specifies the macro file to be used.  The standard <I>cawf</I> distribution
          supplies  macro files to support ``-man'', ``-me'' or ``-ms''.  <I>Cawf</I>
          finds a macro file by constructing its name from `m', <I>acro</I> and  <B>.mac</B>
          - e. g., <B>-m</B><I>an</I> is converted to <B>man.mac</B>.  The  default  directory  for
          macro  files  is defined when <I>cawf</I> is compiled; it's <I>C</I>:\<I>SYS</I>\<I>LIB</I>\<I>CAWF</I>
          in the MS-DOS environment; /<I>usr</I>/<I>lib</I>/<I>cawf</I> in the UNIX environment.

     file ...
          are the names of files containing <I>nroff</I> source text.

<B>NROFF</B> <B>COMPATIBILITY</B>
     <I>Cawf</I> accepts the following raw <I>nroff</I> requests:

          .\"     .ad     .bp     .br     .ce     .de     .di     .ds
          .el     .fi     .fl     .ft     .i0     .ie     .if     .in
          .it     .lg     .li     .ll     .ls     .na     .ne     .nf
          .nr     .ns     .pl     .po     .ps     .rm     .rn     .rr
          .rs     .so     .sp     .ta     .ti     .tm     .tr

     and the following in-text codes:

          \$      \%      \*      \"      \c      \f      \h      \k
          \n      \s      \w

     plus the full list of <I>nroff</I>/<I>troff</I> special characters in the  original  V7
     <I>troff</I> manual.

     Many restrictions are present; the behavior in general  is  a  subset  of
     <I>nroff</I>'s.  Of particular note are the following:

     <B>o</B> The fully supported nroff request  control  character  is  the  period.
       There  is  limited  support  for  the   non-break, acute accent control
       character.

     <B>o</B> Point sizes do not exist; <B>.ps</B> is ignored.

     <B>o</B> Special vertical spacing - the <B>.vs</B> request included - is ignored.

     <B>o</B> Conditionals cover only the numeric comparisons &gt;, =, &lt;, &gt;= and  &lt;=  on
       <B>\n(.$</B>;  string  comparisons  between a macro parameter and a literal; <B>n</B>
       (always true); and  <B>t</B>  (always  false).   Only  single  line  input  is
       accepted  from conditionals; multi-line input - e.g., \(<I>anything</I>\) - is
       not supported.

     <B>o</B> The handling of strings is generally primitive.

     <B>o</B> Horizontal motion via <B>\h</B>  must  be  supplied  with  a  number  register
       interpolation and must be positive - e. g., <B>\w\n(NN</B>, where the value in
       NN is &gt;= 0.

     <B>o</B> The <B>\k</B> function is reliable only after TAB characters, so it is  useful
       only for measuring table positions.

     <B>o</B> The <B>.di</B> request only turns output on  and  off  -  any  macro  name  is
       ignored.

     <B>o</B> Expressions - e. g., <B>.sp</B> - are reasonably general, but the <B>|</B>, <B>&amp;</B>, and  <B>:</B>
       operators  do  not  exist, there must be white space between the end of
       the <I>nroff</I> function and the beginning of the expression, and <B>\w</B> requires
       that  quote  (')  be  used as the delimiters.  <B>\w</B> counts the characters
       inside the quotes and scales the result in ens, so that,  for  example,
       \w'\(bu' equals 4n, and \w'\(bu'/1n equals 4.

     <B>o</B> The only acceptable count for  the  <B>.it</B>  request  is  one,  and  it  is
       effective only with <B>man</B>, <B>me</B> or <B>ms</B> macros.

     <B>o</B> The default scaling factor is `v' for the <B>.ne</B>, <B>.sp</B>, and <B>.pl</B>  raw  <I>nroff</I>
       requests;  it  is  `u' for <B>.nr</B>; and `n' for <B>.in</B>, <B>.ll</B>, <B>.ls</B>, <B>.po</B>, <B>.ta</B> and
       <B>.ti</B>.  (A different scaling factor may  be  specified  with  a  trailing
       character.)

     <B>o</B> Some obsolete or meaningless requests - <B>.i0</B>, <B>.lg</B> and <B>.li</B> - are silently
       ignored.

     White space at the beginning of lines, and embedded  white  space  within
     lines  is dealt with properly.  Sentence terminators at ends of lines are
     understood to imply extra space afterward in filled lines.  Tabs are  im-
     plemented  crudely  and  not  exactly,  although  usually  they  work  as
     expected.  Hyphenation is done only at explicit hyphens,  em-dashes,  and
     <I>nroff</I>  discretionary  hyphens.  By default bold and italic characters are
     emulated with backspacing and overprinting, but the <B>-d</B>  and  <B>-f</B>  options,
     combined  with the contents of the device configuration file, may be used
     to generate special codes for  bold  and  italic  characters.   (See  the
     <B>DEVICES</B> section for more information.)

<B>MAN</B> <B>MACROS</B>
     The <B>man</B> macro set replicates the full V7 manual macros, plus a few  semi-
     random oddballs.  The full list is:

          .AT     .B      .BI     .BR     .BY     .DE     .DT     .HP
          .I      .IB     .IP     .IR     .IX     .LP     .NB     .P
          .PD     .PP     .RB     .RE     .RI     .RS     .SH     .SM
          .SS     .TH     .TP     .UC

     <B>.BY</B> and <B>.NB</B> each take a single string argument  (respectively,  an  indi-
     cation  of authorship and a note about the status of the manual page) and
     arrange to place it in the page footer.  <B>.AT</B> and <B>.IX</B> do nothing.

<B>ME</B> <B>MACROS</B>
     The <B>me</B> macro subset has been derived from the  <I>cawf</I>  <B>ms</B>  macros  by  Chet
     Creider &lt;creider@csd.uwo.ca&gt;.  It includes:


          .(l     .(q     .)l     .)q     .b      .bu     .i      .ip
          .lp     .np     .pp     .r      .sh     .sm     .u      .uh

     The .(l C and .(l L options are supported.  In addition,  the  .AB,  .AE,
     .AI,  .AU,  .DA,  .ND,  .TL and .UX macros have been retained from the <B>ms</B>
     set, and the .XP macro has been borrowed from the Berkeley  additions  to
     the <B>ms</B> macro set.

<B>MS</B> <B>MACROS</B>
     The <B>ms</B> macro set is a substantial subset of  the  V7  manuscript  macros.
     The macros are:

          .AB     .AE     .AI     .AU     .B      .CD     .DA     .DE
          .DS     .I      .ID     .IP     .LD     .LG     .LP     .ND
          .NH     .NL     .PP     .QE     .QP     .QS     .R      .RE
          .RP     .RS     .SH     .SM     .TL     .TP     .UL     .UX

     Size changes are recognized but ignored, as are <B>.RP</B> and  <B>.ND</B>.   <B>.UL</B>  just
     prints  its  argument in italics.  <B>.DS</B>/<B>.DE</B> does not do a keep, nor do any
     of the other macros that normally imply keeps.

     The <B>DY</B> string variable is available.  The <B>PD</B>, <B>PI</B>, and <B>LL</B> number registers
     exist and can be changed.

<B>HEADERS</B> <B>AND</B> <B>FOOTERS</B>
     <I>Cawf</I> allows the placement of text into the five line  header  and  footer
     sections  from  the  <B>LH</B>, <B>CH</B>, <B>RF</B>, <B>LF</B>, <B>CF</B>, and <B>RF</B> string variables, via the
     control of the <B>.^b</B> request:

     .^b fh 1   enables header string placement on the first page
     .^b fh 0   disables header string placement on the first page
     .^b HF 1   enables header/footer string placement
     .^b HF 0   disables header/footer string placement

     There are appropriate <B>.^b</B> requests in the distribution  <B>man</B>,  <B>me</B>  and  <B>ms</B>
     macro files.  (The <B>me</B> and <B>ms</B> macro files use another <B>.^b</B> request, <B>.^b</B> <B>NH</B>,
     to enable numbered header processing.)

<B>OUTPUT</B>
     The default output format supported by <I>cawf</I>, in its distributed form,  is
     that  appropriate to a dumb terminal, using overprinting for italics (via
     underlining) and bold.  The <I>nroff</I> special characters are printed as  some
     vague  approximation  (it's  sometimes  extremely vague) to their correct
     appearance.

     One part of <I>cawf</I>'s  knowledge  of  the  output  device,  related  to  the
     formation  of  characters, is established by a device file, which is read
     before the user's input.  The search for  it  begins  in  <I>cawf</I>'s  library
     directory,  under  the name <I>term</I>.<B>dev</B> (where <I>term</I> is the value of the TERM
     environment variable).  Failing to find that, <I>cawf</I> searches for <B>dumb.dev</B>.
     (See the <B>FILES</B> section for a description of the path  to  <I>cawf</I>'s  library
     directory.)   The  device  file  uses special internal requests to set up
     resolution, special characters and more normal <I>nroff</I> functions to set  up
     page length, etc.

     <I>Cawf</I> has limited support for fonts  special  forms  of  bold  and  italic
     characters.   It  is  provided through the <B>-c</B> <I>config</I>, <B>-d</B><I>device</I> and <B>-f</B><I>font</I>
     options.  See the <B>DEVICES</B> section for more information.

     Note  the  distinction  between  the  device  and   the   output   device
     configuration  files.   The  device file typically defines characters and
     constant output parameters.  The output device configuration file defines
     font  and  type  face  codes.   It  is  usually not necessary to define a
     separate device file for each device represented  in  the  output  device
     configuration file - the <I>dumb</I>.<I>dev</I> device file will suffice for almost all
     representations.

<B>DEVICES</B>
     <I>Cawf</I> supports primitive output device configuration  for  font  and  type
     face  control.   One  font  may  be  selected  for the entire document by
     directing <I>cawf</I> to issue a font selection control character string at  the
     beginning  of the document, and control character strings may be selected
     for switching between the bold, italic and Roman type faces.

     The <B>-c</B> <I>config</I>, <B>-d</B><I>device</I> and <B>-f</B><I>font</I> options direct the font and type  face
     selections.

     The <B>-d</B><I>device</I> option specifies the name of the  device.   <I>Cawf</I>  has  three
     built-in  devices  -  ANSI,  NONE  and  NORMAL.   When the ANSI device is
     selected, <I>cawf</I> issues the ANSI shadow mode control codes, ``ESC [ 7  m'',
     to  represent the bold face; the ANSI underscore control codes, ``ESC [ 4
     m'', to represent the italic face; and the ANSI control codes, ``ESC [  0
     m'',  to  represent the ROMAN face.  No <B>-f</B><I>font</I> specification is permitted
     with the ANSI device.

     When the NONE device is selected, <I>cawf</I> uses no special  output  codes  to
     represent  the type faces.  No <B>-f</B><I>font</I> specification is permitted with the
     ANSI device.

     The NORMAL output device  is  the  default.   When  it's  selected,  <I>cawf</I>
     overprints  each  bold character two times, using three issuances of each
     bold  character,  separated  by  backspace  characters;  it   issues   an
     underscore  and  backspace  before  each  italic  character.   No  <B>-f</B><I>font</I>
     specification is permitted with the ANSI device.   The  <B><A HREF="../man1/bsfilt.1.html">bsfilt(1)</A></B>  filter
     may  be  used  to further process the backspace codes output for a NORMAL
     device.

     All other devices named in the <B>-d</B><I>device</I> option must be represented  by  a
     stanza  in  the device configuration file.  The device configuration file
     is usually contained in <I>device</I>.<I>cf</I> in <I>cawf</I>'<I>s</I> library  directory  (see  the
     <B>FILES</B> section for more information).  An alternate  device  configuration
     file path may be specified with the <B>-c</B><I>config</I> option.

     The <B>DEVICE</B> <B>CONFIGURATION</B> <B>FILE</B> section describes the organization  of  the
     device  configuration  file.   It is easy to add devices to the <I>device</I>.<I>cf</I>
     supplied in the <I>cawf</I> distribution.

     The <B>-f</B><I>font</I> option  may  be  used  with  the  <B>-d</B><I>device</I>  option,  when  the
     appropriate stanza in the device configuration file contains an entry for
     the named <I>font</I>.  The <B>DEVICE</B>  <B>CONFIGURATION</B>  <B>FILE</B>  section  describes  how
     fonts are defined in device configuration file stanzas.

<B>DEVICE</B> <B>CONFIGURATION</B> <B>FILE</B>
     The  device  configuration  file  defines  the  special  character  codes
     necessary  to  direct output devices to select fonts and to produce bold,
     italic and Roman type faces.

     The configuration file is usually found in <I>device</I>.<I>cf</I>  in  <I>cawf</I>'s  library
     directory  (see the <B>FILES</B> section for more information).  It is organized
     into two main parts - comments and  device  stanzas.   Comments  are  any
     lines  that  begin  with  the  pound  sign  (`#')  character.   They  are
     informational only and <I>cawf</I> ignores them.  <I>Cawf</I> also ignores empty lines,
     so they may be used as vertical white space.

     Stanzas name devices and define their font and type face control strings.
     A stanza begins with the name of the device, starting at the beginning of
     a line and occupying the entire line.  The body of the  stanza,  defining
     fonts  and  type  faces, is formed of lines beginning with white space (a
     TAB or space characters) that directly follow the device name.

     Individual lines of the stanza body contain a key character, followed  by
     a  equal  sign,  followed by the font name (if a font key) and the output
     device control codes.  <I>Cawf</I> issues the font control codes  once,  at  the
     beginning  of  output,  so  only one font may be selected.  The type face
     control codes are issued at each change of type face.

     The key characters are:

          b          for bold
          f          for font definition
          i          for italic
          r          for Roman

     The `b', `i' and `r' key codes are followed by an equal  sign  (`=')  and
     their  control code definition.  The `f' key code is followed by an equal
     sign (`='), the font name, another equal sign and the font  control  code
     definition.



     Control code definitions may  contain  any  printable  ASCII  characters.
     Non-printable characters may be encoded in octal notation with the `\nnn'
     form or in hexadecimal with the `\xnn' form.  The special code, `\E'  (or
     `\e') represents the ESC control character (\033 or \x1b).

     Here's a sample showing the definition for  the  HP  LaserJet  III.   The
     stanza  name  is ``lj3''.  All its non-printable characters are ESCs; the
     first is coded in  octal  form;  the  second  with  '\E';  the  rest,  in
     hexadecimal  form.   TAB is used as the leading white space character for
     the stanza body lines.

          # HP LaserJet III

     <I>C</I>:\<I>SYS</I>\<I>LIB</I>\<I>CAWF</I>,  the  MS-DOS  environment default; or /<I>usr</I>/<I>lib</I>/<I>cawf</I>, the
     UNIX environment default.   These  defaults  can  be  overridden  by  the
     CAWFLIB environment variable, or changed in the cawflib.h header file.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     Unlike <I>nroff</I>, <I>cawf</I> complains whenever  it  sees  unknown  requests.   All
     diagnostics appear on the standard error file.

<B>HISTORY</B>
     Vic Abell of Purdue University &lt;abe@cc.purdue.edu&gt; derived <I>cawf</I> from <I>awf</I>,
     ``the  Amazingly Workable (text) Formatter,'' written by Henry Spencer of
     the University of Toronto.  The Toronto work was a supplement  to  the  C
     News  project.   The  Purdue  effort  was aimed at producing a C language
     version that would run on small systems, particularly MS-DOS  ones.   The
     adaptation    of    the    <B>me</B>   macros   was   done   by   Chet   Creider
     &lt;creider@csd.uwo.ca&gt;.  Chet also contributed ideas for device,  font  and
     type face support.



     The MS-DOS version  of  <I>cawf</I>  has  been  compiled  with  version  2.5  of
     Microsoft's  Quick-C  compiler.   It  runs  under the Mortis Kern Systems
     Toolkit KornShell, <B><A HREF="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh(1)</A></B>, and COMMAND.COM.

<B>BUGS</B>
     Nroff and  troff  mavens  will  have  many  complaints.   Some  may  even
     represent bugs and not deliberate omissions.

     Watch out for scaling factors - especially on requests like <B>\w</B>.

     The overprinting required to create bold  and  italicized  characters  is
     tiresome  on  a  slow  printer.   The  <B><A HREF="../man1/bsfilt.1.html">bsfilt(1)</A></B>  post-filter  from  this
     distribution may be used to  alleviate  that  nuisance  by  managing  the
     backspacing codes from <I>cawf</I>'s NORMAL device output.

     The printing of bold and italic characters is sometimes better handled by
     special printer codes.  Use <I>cawf</I>'s <B>-c</B> <I>config</I>, <B>-d</B><I>device</I> and <B>-f</B><I>font</I> options
     to produce special font and device output control codes.

     <I>Cawf</I> has a small amount of built-in code for the <B>man</B>,  <B>me</B>  and  <B>ms</B>  macro
     packages, but none for any others.

     The stacking for the <B>.so</B> request is limited.

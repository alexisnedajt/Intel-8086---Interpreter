     dhrystone - integer benchmark

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>dhrystone</B>

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     <B>dhrystone</B>           # Run the dhrystone benchmark

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     Many years ago, a floating-point benchmark called <I>whetstone</I>  was  popular
     for benchmarking FORTRAN programs.  Nowadays, an integer benchmark called
     <I>dhrystone</I> is widely used for benchmarking UNIX systems.  This is it.   Be
     warned,   however,  that  <I>dhrystone</I>  is  entirely  CPU  bound,  and  goes
     blindingly fast on machines with high-speed caches.  Although this  is  a
     good  measure  for  programs  that spend most of their time in some inner
     loop, it is a poor benchmark for I/O bound applications.

<B>NAME</B>
     fmt - adjust line-length for paragraphs of text

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>fmt</B> [-<I>width</I>] [<I>files</I>]...

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>fmt</I> is a simple text formatter.   It  inserts  or  deletes  newlines,  as
     necessary,  to  make  all  lines in a paragraph be approximately the same
     width.  It preserves indentation and word spacing.

     The default line width is 72 characters.  You can override this with  the
     -<I>width</I>  flag.   If you don't name any files on the command line, then <I>fmt</I>
     will read from stdin.

     It is typically used from within <I>vi</I> to adjust the line breaks in a single
     paragraph.  To do this, move the cursor to the top of the paragraph, type
     "!}fmt", and hit &lt;Return&gt;.

<B>NAME</B>
     make - a program for maintaining large programs

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>make</B> [<B>-f</B> <I>file</I>] [<B>-adeiknpqrst</B>] [<I>option</I>] ... [<I>target</I>]

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-f</B>   Use <I>file</I> as the makefile

     <B>-d</B>   Print debugging information

     <B>-e</B>   Environment overrides makefile macros

     <B>-i</B>   Ignore status returned by commands

     <B>-k</B>   On error, skip to next command

     <B>-n</B>   Report, but do not execute

     <B>-p</B>   Print macros and targets

     <B>-q</B>   Question up-to-dateness of target

     <B>-r</B>   Rule inhibit; do not use default rules

     <B>-s</B>   Silent mode

     <B>-t</B>   Touch files instead of making them

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     <B>make</B> <B>kernel</B>         # Make <I>kernel</I> up to date

     <B>make</B> <B>-n</B> <B>-f</B> <B>mfile</B>    # Tell what needs to be done

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Make</I> is a program that is normally used  for  developing  large  programs
     consisting  of  multiple  files.   It  keeps  track of which object files
     depend on which source and  header  files.   When  called,  it  does  the
     minimum amount of recompilation to bring the target file up to date.

     The file dependencies are expected  in  <I>makefile</I>  or  <I>Makefile</I>  ,  unless
     another file is specified with <B>-f</B>.  <I>Make</I> has some default rules built in,
     for example, it knows how to make .<I>o</I> files from  .<I>c</I>  files.   Here  is  a
     sample <I>makefile</I> .



       d=/user/ast                            # <I>d</I> is a macro
       program: head.o tail.o                 # <I>program</I> depends on these
                cc -o program head.o tail.o   # tells how to make <I>program</I>
                echo Program done.            # announce completion
       head.o:  $d/def.h head.c               # <I>head</I>.<I>o</I> depends on these
       tail.o:  $d/var.h tail.c               # <I>tail</I>.<I>o</I> depends on these

     A complete description of <I>make</I> would require too much space  here.   Many
     books  on  UNIX  discuss <I>make</I> . Study the numerous <I>Makefiles</I> in the MINIX
     source tree for examples.

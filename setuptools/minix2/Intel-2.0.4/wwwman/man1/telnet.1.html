<B>NAME</B>
     telnet - user interface to the TELNET protocol

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     telnet [ <I>host</I> [ <I>port</I> ] ]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Telnet</I> is  used  to  communicate  with  another  host  using  the  <B>TELNET</B>
     protocol.   If  <I>telnet</I>  is  invoked  without arguments, it enters command
     mode, indicated by its prompt ("telnet&gt;").  In this mode, it accepts  and
     executes  the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with arguments, it
     performs an <B>open</B> command (see below) with those arguments.

     Once a connection has been opened, <I>telnet</I>  enters  an  input  mode.   The
     input mode entered will be either "character at a time" or "line by line"
     depending on what the remote system supports.

     In "character at a time" mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the
     remote host for processing.

     In "line by line" mode, all text is echoed locally, and  (normally)  only
     completed  lines are sent to the remote host.  The "local echo character"
     (initially "^E") may be used to turn off and  on  the  local  echo  (this
     would  mostly  be  used  to  enter  passwords  without the password being
     echoed).

     In either mode, if the <I>localchars</I> toggle is TRUE  (the  default  in  line
     mode; see below), the user's <I>quit</I>, <I>intr</I>, and <I>flush</I> characters are trapped
     locally, and sent as <B>TELNET</B> protocol sequences to the remote side.  There
     are options (see <B>toggle</B> <I>autoflush</I> and <B>toggle</B> <I>autosynch</I> below) which cause
     this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal (until the  remote
     host  acknowledges the <B>TELNET</B> sequence) and flush previous terminal input
     (in the case of <I>quit</I> and <I>intr</I>).

     While connected to a remote host, <I>telnet</I> command mode may be  entered  by
     typing  the  <I>telnet</I> "escape character" (initially "^]").  When in command
     mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.

     <B>COMMANDS</B>

     The following commands are available.  Only enough  of  each  command  to
     uniquely  identify  it  need be typed (this is also true for arguments to
     the <B>mode</B>, <B>set</B>, <B>toggle</B>, and <B>display</B> commands).

     <B>open</B> <I>host</I> [ <I>port</I> ]
          Open a  connection  to  the  named  host.   If  no  port  number  is
          specified,  <I>telnet</I>  will  attempt  to contact a <B>TELNET</B> server at the
          default port.  The host specification may be either a host name (see
          <B><A HREF="../man5/hosts.5.html">hosts(5)</A></B>)  or  an  Internet  address specified in the "dot notation"
          (see <B><A HREF="../man3/inet.3n.html">inet(3N)</A></B>).

     <B>close</B>
          Close a <B>TELNET</B> session and return to command mode.

     <B>quit</B>
          Close any open <B>TELNET</B> session and exit <I>telnet</I>.  An end of  file  (in
          command mode) will also close a session and exit.

     <B>z</B>
          Suspend <I>telnet</I>.  This command only works when the user is using  the
          <B><A HREF="../man1/csh.1.html">csh(1)</A></B>.

     <B>mode</B> <I>type</I>
          <I>Type</I> is either <I>line</I> (for "line by  line"  mode)  or  <I>character</I>  (for
          "character  at  a  time"  mode).   The  remote  host  is  asked  for
          permission to go into the requested mode.  If  the  remote  host  is
          capable of entering that mode, the requested mode will be entered.

     <B>status</B>
          Show the current status of <I>telnet</I>.  This includes the  peer  one  is
          connected to, as well as the current mode.

     <B>display</B> [ <I>argument</I>... ]
          Displays all, or some, of the <B>set</B> and <B>toggle</B> values (see below).

     <B>?</B> [ <I>command</I> ]
          Get help.  With no arguments, <I>telnet</I> prints a help  summary.   If  a
          command  is  specified,  <I>telnet</I>  will print the help information for
          just that command.

     <B>send</B> <I>arguments</I>
          Sends one or more special character sequences to  the  remote  host.
          The  following  are  the arguments which may be specified (more than
          one argument may be specified at a time):

     <I>escape</I>
          Sends the current <I>telnet</I> escape character (initially "^]").

     <I>synch</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>SYNCH</B> sequence.  This sequence  causes  the  remote
          system  to  discard  all  previously typed (but not yet read) input.
          This sequence is sent as TCP urgent data (and may not  work  if  the
          remote  system  is  a  4.2 BSD system -- if it doesn't work, a lower
          case "r" may be echoed on the terminal).

     <I>brk</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>BRK</B> (Break) sequence, which may  have  significance
          to the remote system.



     <I>ip</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>IP</B> (Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause
          the remote system to abort the currently running process.

     <I>ao</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>AO</B> (Abort Output) sequence, which should cause  the
          remote  system  to  flush  all  output <B>from</B> the remote system <B>to</B> the
          user's terminal.

     <I>ayt</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>AYT</B> (Are You There) sequence, to which  the  remote
          system may or may not choose to respond.

     <I>ec</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>EC</B> (Erase Character) sequence, which  should  cause
          the remote system to erase the last character entered.

     <I>el</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>EL</B> (Erase Line) sequence, which  should  cause  the
          remote system to erase the line currently being entered.

     <I>ga</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B>  <B>GA</B>  (Go  Ahead)  sequence,  which  likely  has  no
          significance to the remote system.

     <I>nop</I>
          Sends the <B>TELNET</B> <B>NOP</B> (No OPeration) sequence.

     ?
          Prints out help information for the <B>send</B> command.

     <B>set</B> <I>argument</I> <I>value</I>
          Set any one of a number of <I>telnet</I> variables  to  a  specific  value.
          The  special  value "off" turns off the function associated with the
          variable.  The values of variables  may  be  interrogated  with  the
          <B>display</B> command.  The variables which may be specified are:

     <I>echo</I>
          This is the value (initially "^E") which, when  in  "line  by  line"
          mode, toggles between doing local echoing of entered characters (for
          normal processing), and suppressing echoing  of  entered  characters
          (for entering, say, a password).

     <I>escape</I>
          This is the <I>telnet</I> escape character (initially  "^[")  which  causes
          entry into <I>telnet</I> command mode (when connected to a remote system).

     <I>interrupt</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is in <I>localchars</I> mode (see <B>toggle</B>  <I>localchars</I>  below)  and
          the  <I>interrupt</I> character is typed, a <B>TELNET</B> <B>IP</B> sequence (see <B>send</B> <I>ip</I>
          above) is sent to the  remote  host.   The  initial  value  for  the
          interrupt character is taken to be the terminal's <B>intr</B> character.

     <I>quit</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is in <I>localchars</I> mode (see <B>toggle</B>  <I>localchars</I>  below)  and
          the  <I>quit</I>  character  is  typed, a <B>TELNET</B> <B>BRK</B> sequence (see <B>send</B> <I>brk</I>
          above) is sent to the remote host.  The initial value for  the  quit
          character is taken to be the terminal's <B>quit</B> character.

     <I>flushoutput</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is in <I>localchars</I> mode (see <B>toggle</B>  <I>localchars</I>  below)  and
          the  <I>flushoutput</I>  character is typed, a <B>TELNET</B> <B>AO</B> sequence (see <B>send</B>
          <I>ao</I> above) is sent to the remote host.  The  initial  value  for  the
          flush character is taken to be the terminal's <B>flush</B> character.

     <I>erase</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is in <I>localchars</I> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <I>localchars</I>  below),  <B>and</B>
          if <I>telnet</I> is operating in "character at a time" mode, then when this
          character is typed, a <B>TELNET</B> <B>EC</B> sequence (see <B>send</B> <I>ec</I> above) is sent
          to  the remote system.  The initial value for the erase character is
          taken to be the terminal's <B>erase</B> character.

     <I>kill</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is in <I>localchars</I> mode (see <B>toggle</B> <I>localchars</I>  below),  <B>and</B>
          if <I>telnet</I> is operating in "character at a time" mode, then when this
          character is typed, a <B>TELNET</B> <B>EL</B> sequence (see <B>send</B> <I>el</I> above) is sent
          to  the  remote system.  The initial value for the kill character is
          taken to be the terminal's <B>kill</B> character.

     <I>eof</I>
          If <I>telnet</I> is  operating  in  "line  by  line"  mode,  entering  this
          character as the first character on a line will cause this character
          to be sent to the remote system.   The  initial  value  of  the  eof
          character is taken to be the terminal's <B>eof</B> character.

     <B>toggle</B> <I>arguments</I>...
          Toggle (between TRUE and  FALSE)  various  flags  that  control  how
          <I>telnet</I> responds to events.  More than one argument may be specified.
          The state of these  flags  may  be  interrogated  with  the  <B>display</B>
          command.  Valid arguments are:

     <I>localchars</I>
          If this is TRUE, then the <I>flush</I>, <I>interrupt</I>, <I>quit</I>,  <I>erase</I>,  and  <I>kill</I>
          characters  (see  <B>set</B> above) are recognized locally, and transformed
          into (hopefully) appropriate <B>TELNET</B> control sequences  (respectively
          <I>ao</I>,  <I>ip</I>,  <I>brk</I>,  <I>ec</I>,  and <I>el</I>; see <B>send</B> above).  The initial value for
          this toggle is TRUE in "line by line" mode, and FALSE in  "character
          at a time" mode.


     <I>autoflush</I>
          If <I>autoflush</I> and <I>localchars</I> are both TRUE, then when the  <I>ao</I>,  <I>intr</I>,
          or  <I>quit</I>  characters  are  recognized  (and  transformed into <B>TELNET</B>
          sequences; see <B>set</B> above for details), <I>telnet</I> refuses to display any
          data  on  the  user's  terminal until the remote system acknowledges
          (via a <B>TELNET</B> <I>Timing</I> <I>Mark</I> option) that it has processed those <B>TELNET</B>
          sequences.   The  initial  value  for  this  toggle  is  TRUE if the
          terminal user had not done an "stty noflsh",  otherwise  FALSE  (see
          <B><A HREF="../man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</A></B>).

     <I>autosynch</I>
          If <I>autosynch</I> and <I>localchars</I> are both TRUE, then when either the <I>intr</I>
          or  <I>quit</I>  characters is typed (see <B>set</B> above for descriptions of the
          <I>intr</I> and <I>quit</I> characters), the resulting  <B>TELNET</B>  sequence  sent  is
          followed  by the <B>TELNET</B> <B>SYNCH</B> sequence.  This procedure <B>should</B> cause
          the remote system to begin throwing away all previously typed  input
          until  both  of  the <B>TELNET</B> sequences have been read and acted upon.
          The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.

     <I>crmod</I>
          Toggle carriage return  mode.   When  this  mode  is  enabled,  most
          carriage  return  characters  received  from the remote host will be
          mapped into a carriage return followed by a line  feed.   This  mode
          does  not  affect  those  characters  typed  by the user, only those
          received from the remote host.  This mode is not very useful  unless
          the  remote  host  only  sends carriage return, but never line feed.
          The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

     <I>debug</I>
          Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the <I>super</I>user).   The
          initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

     <I>options</I>
          Toggles the display of  some  internal  <I>telnet</I>  protocol  processing
          (having  to  do  with  <B>TELNET</B>  options).  The initial value for this
          toggle is FALSE.

     <I>netdata</I>
          Toggles the display of all network  data  (in  hexadecimal  format).
          The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

     ?
          Displays the legal <B>toggle</B> commands.

<B>BUGS</B>

     There is no adequate way for dealing with flow control.



     On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually when in  "line
     by line" mode.

     There is enough settable state to justify a .<I>telnetrc</I> file.

     No capability for a .<I>telnetrc</I> file is provided.

     In "line by line" mode, the terminal's <I>eof</I> character is  only  recognized
     (and sent to the remote system) when it is the first character on a line.

<B>NAME</B>
     su - temporary become superuser or another user

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>su</B> [<B>-</B>[<B>e</B>]] [<I>user</I> [<I>shell</I>-<I>arguments</I> ...]]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Su</B> can be used to temporarily run a  shell  under  the  identity  of  the
     superuser or another user.  Unless the caller is a member of the operator
     group, one is prompted for the password of the  user-to-be.   Calls  that
     need  a  password  are  logged, whether they succeed or not.  The default
     user is <B>root</B>.  Further arguments are handed to the shell.  By default the
     shell  started is the shell of the invoker, and the environment is passed
     on as is.

     The activities of <B>su</B> are logged through <B><A HREF="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</A></B> under Minix-vmd.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-</B>    Constructs a new environment consisting of the <B>PATH</B>, <B>USER</B>,  <B>LOGNAME</B>,
          <B>HOME</B>,  <B>SHELL</B>,  <B>TERM</B>,  <B>TERMCAP</B>, and <B>TZ</B> variables.  The environment is
          the same as on a normal login, except that <B>TERM</B>, <B>TERMCAP</B> and <B>TZ</B>  are
          copied  from  the  current  environment if set.  The current working
          directory is changed to the user home directory, the  shell  of  the
          user-to-be  is  run,  and  it  is started as a login shell, with the
          first character a minus sign.

     <B>-e</B>   Like above, but the shell is started normally, not as a login shell.

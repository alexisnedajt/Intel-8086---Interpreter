<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Fsck</I> performs consistency checks on the file systems which reside on  the
     specified  devices.  <I>Fsck1</I> is an alternate version for use on obsolete V1
     file systems.  When either the <B>-a</B> or <B>-r</B> flags are given, the file  system
     will  be  repaired if errors are found.  Before running <I>fsck</I> on a mounted
     file system, it must first be unmounted.  Trying to repair a mounted file
     system is dangerous and should not be attempted.

     To repair the root file system (which cannot be  unmounted),  first  type
     CTRL-F9  at  the  console  to kill any and all processes.  Log back in as
     <B>root</B>, type <I>sync</I> to force any buffered changes to disk, run  <I>fsck</I>  on  the
     root file system and immediately reboot the computer by typing <I>reboot</I>.

     It is necessary to kill all processes  before  repairing  the  root  file
     system  to  prevent  them  from  modifying  any disk blocks while <I>fsck</I> is
     running.  This is only necessary for the root file system, any other file
     system can simply be unmounted before it is checked.

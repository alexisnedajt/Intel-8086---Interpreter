     crc - print the checksum of the file data

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>crc</B> <I>file</I> ...

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     <B>crc</B> <B>*.c</B>             # Print checksums of all the C programs

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     The checksum of each argument is computed and  printed,  along  with  the
     file  length and its name, one file per line.  This program is useful for
     seeing if a file transmitted to another machine  has  arrived  correctly.
     It  is  conceptually  similar  to  <I>sum</I>,  except  that  it uses a stronger
     checksum algorithm and also prints the length.

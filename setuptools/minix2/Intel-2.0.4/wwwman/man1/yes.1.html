<B>NAME</B>
     yes - an endless stream of the same word

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>yes</B> [<I>answer</I>]

<B>EXAMPLES</B>

     <B>yes</B> <B>|</B> <B>script</B>        # Answer yes to all questions from the script

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Yes</I> sends out an endless stream of y's, each on one line.  One uses it to
     automatically  say  "yes"  to  all  questions a command may ask.  This is
     useful for commands that ask too many "Are  you  sure?"  questions.   The
     optional  argument makes <I>yes</I> use <I>answer</I> as the word to print instead of a
     single y character.

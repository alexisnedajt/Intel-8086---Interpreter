<B>NAME</B>
     bsfilt, colcrt - a colcrt-like backspace filter

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>bsfilt</B> [ <B>-</B> ] [ <B>-U</B> ] [ file ... ]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <I>Bsfilt</I> filters backspace sequences from the input <I>file</I>(s) (standard input
     if  none)  in  an approximation of <B><A HREF="../man1/colcrt.1.html">colcrt(1)</A></B>.  Both the backspace and the
     character it returns to  are  removed,  unless  they  form  an  underline
     sequence.   Underline  sequences are treated according to the settings of
     the <B>-</B> and <B>-U</B> options.

<B>OPTIONS</B>

     <B>-</B>    specifies that no underlining of  any  kind  is  to  be  propagated.
          Without   this   option   or  the  <B>-U</B>  option,  <I>bsfilt</I>  approximates
          underlining with minus signs (`-') in following lines.

     <B>-U</B>   specifies that underlining with underscore (`_') and backspace (`b')
          character sequences is permitted.

<B>SEE</B> <B>ALSO</B>
     <B><A HREF="../man1/cawf.1.html">cawf(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../man1/colcrt.1.html">colcrt(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff(1)</A></B>.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS</B>
     Diagnostic messages are delivered to the standard error file.

<B>HISTORY</B>
     Vic Abell of Purdue University wrote <I>bsfilt</I> to have  a  backspace  filter
     for <B><A HREF="../man1/cawf.1.html">cawf(1)</A></B> that is independent of licensed source code.

<B>BUGS</B>
     The maximum length of a line that can be underlined with minus  signs  is
     fixed.

     <I>Bsfilt</I> does not examine the characters that  are  being  overprinted  via
     backspace  operations.  Thus, overprinting that is intended to form a new
     character from several different ones is ineffective and  only  the  last
     character  of  the  sequence is propagated - e. g., ``o^H+'', intended to
     look like a bullet, is reduced to `+'.

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Mail</I> is an extremely simple electronic mail program.  It can be  used  to
     send  or  receive  email  on  a  single  MINIX  system,  in which case it
     functions as user agent and local delivery agent. If the flag  <I>MAILER</I>  is
     defined  in  <I>mail</I>.<I>c</I>,  it can also call a transport agent to handle remote
     mail as well.  No such agent is supplied with MINIX.



     When  called  by  <I>user</I>  with  no  arguments,  it  examines  the   mailbox
     /<I>usr</I>/<I>spool</I>/<I>mail</I>/<I>user</I>,  prints one message (depending on the <B>-r</B> flag), and
     waits for one of the following commands:

        &lt;newline&gt;   Go to the next message
        -           Print the previous message
        !command    Fork off a shell and execute <I>command</I>
        CTRL-D      Update the mailbox and quit (same as q)
        d           Delete the current message and go to the next one
        q           Update the mailbox and quit (same as CTRL-D)
        p           Print the current message again
        s [<I>file</I>]    Save message in the named file
        x           Exit without updating the mailbox

     To send mail, the program  is  called  with  the  name  of  one  or  more
     recipients  as  arguments.   The mail is sent, along with a postmark line
     containing the date.   For  local  delivery,  a  file  named  after  each
     recipient  in  the directory /<I>usr</I>/<I>spool</I>/<I>mail</I> must be writable. If a spool
     file does not exist for a recipient it will be created.

     If the directory /<I>usr</I>/<I>spool</I>/<I>mail</I> does not exist then the mail  is  dumped
     on  the console, so that system programs have a way to notify a user on a
     system that does not have a mail spool.

     The received mail contains a To: header showing the recipient.  If  there
     are  multiple  recipients  and  the <B>-t</B> option is specified each recipient
     will also see a Dist: header line showing the other recipients.

     The <B>-s</B> option allows a subject to  be  specified.  The  subject  must  be
     quoted if it contains spaces. If no subject is specified the mail will be
     delivered with Subject: No subject.

<B>NOTES</B>
     The <B>-s</B> option was added to make this simple mail program consistent  with
     mail programs found in other *nix variants.  Many programs, including the
     version of cron distributed with Minix releases 2.0.3 and  later,  report
     their  outcome  by  piping  output to the mail program in order to send a
     mail message to root in lieu of writing a log file.  Such programs  often
     expect the mail program to accept a subject line using this option.

<B>BUGS</B>
     If an  external  <I>MAILER</I>  is  used  it  is  likely  the  conditional  code
     supporting this will need some editing to be made to work correctly.

<B>AUTHOR</B>
     The original mail program for Minix was written by Peter B. Housel.   The
     -e and -t options were added by C. W. Rose. The -s option was added by A.
     S. Woodhull. This man page revised by ASW 2003-07-18.

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Cal</I> prints a calendar for a month or year.  The year can be between 1 and
     9999.  Note  that  the year 91 is not a synonym for 1991, but is itself a
     valid year about 19 centuries ago.  The calendar produced is the one used
     by England and her colonies.  Try Sept. 1752, Feb 1900, and Feb 2000.  If
     you do not understand what is going on, look up <I>Calendar</I>, <I>Gregorian</I> in  a
     good encyclopedia.

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>

     <I>Term</I> allows MINIX to talk to a terminal or modem over RS232 port 1.   The
     program  first  sets  the baudrate, parity and character length, and then
     forks.  The parent sits  in  a  loop  copying  from  <I>stdin</I>  (usually  the
     console's  keyboard),  to  the  terminal or modem (/<I>dev</I>/<I>tty00</I>). The child
     sits in a loop  copying  from  the  terminal  or  modem  (/<I>dev</I>/<I>tty00</I>)  to
     standard  output.  Thus  when RS232 port 1 is connected to a modem, every
     keystroke typed on the keyboard is sent to the modem, and every character
     arriving  from  the modem is displayed.  Standard input and output may be
     redirected, to  provide  a  primitive  file  transfer  program,  with  no
     checking.   Any  argument  that starts with <B>-at</B> is sent out to the modem,
     usually to dial out.  <I>Term</I> accepts several commands that  are  formed  by
     typing the escape character, CTRL-], and a letter.  Type CTRL-]? to see a
     list of commands.  The subshell command is very important, it allows  you
     to  type  in  a  ZMODEM command to transfer data.  Do not quit <I>term</I> to do
     this, or your modem line will be reset!  <I>Term</I> keeps the modem  line  open
     on file descriptor 9 while running the subshell, so you can type

           &lt;&amp;9 &gt;&amp;9

     at the end of your ZMODEM command to  connect  it  to  the  modem.   With
     <B>-c</B><I>kcmd</I> arguments you can bind shell commands to keys.  The character just
     after <B>-c</B> is the key to use, the rest of the characters form  the  command
     to  bind  to  the  key.   This  command  also  has the modem open on file
     descriptor 9.


     Important note:  to  use  <I>term</I>,  it  is  essential  that  /<I>etc</I>/<I>ttytab</I>  is
     configured  so  that there is no login session started on the modem line.
     If there is, both the login session and term will try to  read  from  the
     modem, and nothing will work.

<B>NAME</B>
     rcp - remote file copy

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>rcp</B> [<B>-p</B>] <I>file1</I> <I>file2</I>
     <B>rcp</B> [<B>-pr</B>] <I>file</I> ...  <I>directory</I>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     <B>Rcp</B> copies files between machines.  Each <I>file</I> or  <I>directory</I>  argument  is
     either  a  remote  file  name of the form ``rhost:path'', or a local file
     name (containing no `:' characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     If  the  <B>-r</B>  option  is  specified  and  any  of  the  source  files  are
     directories,  <B>rcp</B>  copies  each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
     the destination must be a directory.

     By default, the mode and owner of  <I>file2</I>  are  preserved  if  it  already
     existed;  otherwise  the mode of the source file modified by the <B><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.html">umask(2)</A></B>
     on the destination host is used.  The <B>-p</B> option causes <B>rcp</B> to attempt  to
     preserve  (duplicate)  in  its copies the modification times and modes of
     the source files, ignoring the <B>umask</B>.

     If <I>path</I> is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to your login
     directory  on  <I>rhost</I>.  A <I>path</I> on a remote host may be quoted (using \, ",
     or ') so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.

     <B>Rcp</B> does not prompt for passwords; your  current  local  user  name  must
     exist on <I>rhost</I> and allow remote command execution via <B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh(1)</A></B>.

     <B>Rcp</B> handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files are
     on the current machine.  Hostnames may also take the form ``rname@rhost''
     to use <I>rname</I> rather than the current user name on the remote  host.   The
     destination  hostname  may  also take the form ``rhost.rname'' to support
     destination machines that are running 4.2BSD versions of <B>rcp</B>.

<B>SEE</B> <B>ALSO</B>
     <B><A HREF="../man1/cp.1.html">cp(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin(1)</A></B>.

<B>BUGS</B>
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be  a  file  in
     cases where only a directory should be legal.
     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a .profile, or  .*shrc
     file on the remote host.
